1435332675154243590 2021-09-07 20:02:31 +0000 <Steven_Ballmer> So sad about the death of Michael K. Williams.  Just loved him as Omar Little. My favorite character in my favorite show. He was a real talent

1298796004515381250 2020-08-27 01:34:32 +0000 <Steven_Ballmer> Now is the time to research and vote for the mayors, council people, commissioners, legislators, governors, judges, prosecutors, and attorneys general who can make it happen. Now is the time to workout a bipartisan national police reform starting with the bill from @RepKarenBass
1298796003043217408 2020-08-27 01:34:32 +0000 <Steven_Ballmer> I am again angry over the shooting of a black man #JacobBlake  @DocRivers and The @Bucks players said it well We need real police accountability. Give citizens data to do so. Let‚Äôs have criminal justice reform that keeps all people safe but not senselessly imprisoned or afraid
1267617262455808000 2020-06-02 00:41:21 +0000 <Steven_Ballmer> @BangaRangRufio1 My bad. Appreciate the feedback
1266583621013368832 2020-05-30 04:14:01 +0000 <Steven_Ballmer> We must hold one another accountable. We (non-black people) must get to work. We must educate ourselves on the history of oppression and discrimination and how it continues today so we can be better allies and advocate for a better future. We can and must do better.
1266583619427905542 2020-05-30 04:14:01 +0000 <Steven_Ballmer> I am so so sad about #GeorgeFloyd and feel for his family.  I am also angry. Everyone in America deserves to live without fear. We need to treat people equally, fairly, respectfully‚Äî especially blacks who often get treated so poorly.
