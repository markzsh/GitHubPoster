We are optimistic about technology‚Äôs awesome potential for good ‚Äî but we know that it won‚Äôt happen on its own.
1055035549512294401 2018-10-24 09:57:31 +0000 <tim_cook> And fourth, everyone has a right to the security of their data. Security is at the heart of all data privacy and privacy rights.
1055035546244911105 2018-10-24 09:57:30 +0000 <tim_cook> Third, companies should recognize that data belongs to users and we should make it easy for people to get a copy of their personal data, as well as correct and delete it.
1055035543933849600 2018-10-24 09:57:29 +0000 <tim_cook> Second, users should always know what data is being collected from them and what it‚Äôs being collected for. This is the only way to empower users to decide what collection is legitimate and what isn‚Äôt. Anything less is a sham.
1055035541996089344 2018-10-24 09:57:29 +0000 <tim_cook> First, companies should challenge themselves to de-identify customer data or not collect that data in the first place.
1055035539915718656 2018-10-24 09:57:28 +0000 <tim_cook> We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right. No matter what country you live in, that right should be protected in keeping with four essential principles:
