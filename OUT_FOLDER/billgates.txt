1593319886763139072 2022-11-17 19:07:18 +0000 <BillGates> Many people don’t know that Mike was a champion for and leader on PEPFAR – the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief – which has saved millions of lives. It’s one of the best things this country has ever done. It will be a lasting part of his legacy.
1593319884439490561 2022-11-17 19:07:17 +0000 <BillGates> I’m very sad to hear about Michael Gerson’s passing. We spoke many times over the years, especially about global health, and when I started talking about pandemic prevention back in 2015, he was one of the first journalists I wanted to talk to.  https://t.co/1MUgLtwhi1

1592964362121392128 2022-11-16 19:34:34 +0000 <BillGates> @OfficialMakueni Thank you. I enjoyed learning from your health team, as well as some of the remarkable individuals who make up the community.
1592592132694757376 2022-11-15 18:55:28 +0000 <BillGates> I believe everyone has a role to play in addressing climate change. Whether you’re an entrepreneur, an inventor, or consumer, we can all help avoid a climate disaster.  https://t.co/qlLNjgq2XD
1591980459667656705 2022-11-14 02:24:53 +0000 <BillGates> When it comes to alleviating the impacts of #climatechange on smallholder farmers, the goal should not simply be giving more food aid. It should be to ensure no aid is needed in the first place.  https://t.co/POXDnJo0tN #COP27
1591575900843569152 2022-11-12 23:37:19 +0000 <BillGates> Those of us who have done the most to cause this problem should help the rest of the world survive it. We owe them that much.  https://t.co/H4dLsGFelO

1590826702502236160 2022-11-10 22:00:16 +0000 <BillGates> While the last steps are proving to be the toughest, I’m optimistic we will eradicate polio. I recently visited @KU_Leuven’s Rega Institute where they’re testing preventative medicine – an important step toward a polio-free world.  https://t.co/VOiM8Yla5I
1589764171021037568 2022-11-07 23:38:09 +0000 <BillGates> The climate crisis is already devastating communities. More funding is necessary to ensure agricultural and technological innovations are widely available to the most vulnerable, helping them adapt to climate change, save lives, and increase economic opportunity.
1588574269226688512 2022-11-04 16:49:54 +0000 <BillGates> I have never met anyone who was more passionate about reducing the world’s worst inequities in health than Paul Farmer. I continue to learn from my dear friend’s life and legacy today.  https://t.co/Mk3HFoiqEn

1585239719457103872 2022-10-26 11:59:36 +0000 <BillGates> I’m deeply grateful for the efforts of partners like President @MohamedBinZayed who have helped reduce the global polio burden by 99.9% and prevented an estimated 20 million children from being paralyzed. Together, we can overcome the last hurdles and achieve a polio-free world.
1585052961511976960 2022-10-25 23:37:29 +0000 <BillGates> Testing for viruses with a breathalyzer? It’s possible. Pretty incredible to see the innovative work happening at @imec_int.  https://t.co/wRMLvd7Gk0

1583163067185364997 2022-10-20 18:27:43 +0000 <BillGates> To understand what it will take to get to zero, we need to start by asking where the 51 billion tons of emissions come from:  https://t.co/S8d3tH98nk #MastersofScaleSummit  https://t.co/oOb77eqPnD
1582935064043655169 2022-10-20 03:21:43 +0000 <BillGates> The @Breakthrough Energy Summit is officially a wrap. Reaching net-zero emissions will be the hardest thing humanity has ever done – but I’m leaving today with an increased sense of hope.  https://t.co/7zxKbypNOS

1582839025013993472 2022-10-19 21:00:05 +0000 <BillGates> Grateful for your and @SecGranholm’s leadership. While we have made significant strides in climate innovation, we need more Breakthroughs.
1582836627839143938 2022-10-19 20:50:34 +0000 <BillGates> @JohnKerry @SecGranholm It’s unrealistic to expect people to stop traveling by plane. We must scale innovations that decarbonize the aviation industry. @LanzaJet will help us achieve this by building the world’s first plant for turning alcohol into sustainable aviation fuel.  https://t.co/PMkbUl5i4Y
1582734932983836672 2022-10-19 14:06:28 +0000 <BillGates> Yesterday was an important step toward a polio-free world: $2.6 billion committed will help protect millions of children. Thank you @SvenjaSchulze68, @Rotary, and the many other donors who pledged support. Let’s keep this momentum and #EndPolio together.
1582575717312700421 2022-10-19 03:33:48 +0000 <BillGates> I’m leaving day 1 of #BESummit2022 feeling optimistic about the future after meeting with innovators who are developing the solutions we need to reach net-zero emissions.  https://t.co/m0eSYkqcnP

1582428182912716801 2022-10-18 17:47:33 +0000 <BillGates> @Breakthrough In the run-up to the meeting, I decided to write out my thoughts on the state of the transition to zero.  https://t.co/u8vyjhoUHt
1582427783149461504 2022-10-18 17:45:58 +0000 <BillGates> This week, @Breakthrough Energy is starting an annual tradition. We’re hosting a gathering in Seattle where scientists, inventors, entrepreneurs, public officials, and corporate leaders from around the world will talk about what it’s going to take to get to net-zero emissions.
1582427087863836673 2022-10-18 17:43:12 +0000 <BillGates> I believe we’ll be able to avoid a climate disaster. The ultimate measure of success is global greenhouse-gas emissions: we need to go from 51 billion tons a year to 0 in the next three decades. I’m optimistic we can get there – if we take the right steps.  https://t.co/gy25a2P4sa
1582144794775629824 2022-10-17 23:01:28 +0000 <BillGates> I’m bear-y honored to receive this adorable bear carrying such an urgent message: #EndPolio.

1581345032359276544 2022-10-15 18:03:30 +0000 <BillGates> India's success against poliovirus showed the world that to #EndPolio, perseverance and collaboration are vital. @naveenthacker and over 1,300 leading global experts have urged the world to recommit to ending polio.  https://t.co/hGRdb6u5NK
1581000867943440384 2022-10-14 19:15:55 +0000 <BillGates> The recent case of polio in New York is a reminder that polio anywhere is a threat everywhere. It's vital for the world to not lose sight of our goal to #EndPolio for good.  https://t.co/gymrZXjPYA
1580966325991919616 2022-10-14 16:58:39 +0000 <BillGates> This is great news. Dr. Rajiv Bahl’s commitment to child and maternal health is exemplary. Congratulations on this appointment.
1580641300441071617 2022-10-13 19:27:07 +0000 <BillGates> I loved learning about exciting research underway at @jaramillogroup to convert water and carbon dioxide into fuels and fertilizer:  https://t.co/cuJAVHK7zT  https://t.co/p6Lk4yuAbe
1580328523348078592 2022-10-12 22:44:15 +0000 <BillGates> It’s hard for even the most promising low-carbon technologies to make it all the way to market. The @Breakthrough Energy Fellows program empowers early-stage innovators like @Molten_Ind to grow from their garage and deliver the solutions the world needs to get to zero emissions.
1579238173833834496 2022-10-09 22:31:36 +0000 <BillGates> Progress in health, climate, and education is driven by impatient optimists. Great read by @_HannahRitchie.  https://t.co/hgpAYKUEni

1577697090842808320 2022-10-05 16:27:53 +0000 <BillGates> This #WorldTeachersDay, I’m thinking about Mrs. Caffiere. She was the school librarian at Seattle’s View Ridge Elementary. When I was 9 years old, she took me under her wing and taught me that my love of reading was a strength. To this day, I think about how she changed my life.  https://t.co/oucGBP7n0L

1575990236785491969 2022-09-30 23:25:27 +0000 <BillGates> Thanks for dedicating your career to keeping the world informed, @edyong209. I hope you have a restful sabbatical.
1575990233622904832 2022-09-30 23:25:26 +0000 <BillGates> The world can end this pandemic while also preventing the next. As @edyong209 shares, "such changes seem unrealistic given the relentless disappointments of the past three years, but substantial social progress always seems unfeasible until it is actually achieved."
1575937878776897537 2022-09-30 19:57:24 +0000 <BillGates> A moving story about the universal power of books.  https://t.co/fRu9LXRlgf

1575240644599025664 2022-09-28 21:46:50 +0000 <BillGates> Leaders like @wiiiiza make me optimistic for our future. Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to meet Farwiza and was so impressed by her work protecting the Leuser ecosystem in Indonesia.
1573068713577816067 2022-09-22 21:56:22 +0000 <BillGates> Thanks for bringing levity to such a serious issue yesterday, @kalpenn. I learned a lot from @noupside and @govindethiraj about how we can be better consumers of information and rebuild trust in institutions.  https://t.co/ebgmpwbZJU
1573057395852546049 2022-09-22 21:11:23 +0000 <BillGates> @UlrichJvV @gatesfoundation @GatesAfrica I think everyone was thankful I wasn't the lead chef. I'll be thinking of @ChefPierreThiam's salad and conversation for days.
1572744159185801218 2022-09-22 00:26:42 +0000 <BillGates> #Goalkeepers2030 was filled with laughter, impactful storytelling, and innovative ideas that left me feeling inspired.  https://t.co/GllXLALz4O
1572705133422858240 2022-09-21 21:51:37 +0000 <BillGates> This month, we’re committing $912 million to help replenish the Global Fund through 2026 to expand access to health services around the world and build resilient health systems to prevent future pandemics in the #FightForWhatCounts.  https://t.co/SJhgfN0y7t
1572705132143607808 2022-09-21 21:51:37 +0000 <BillGates> I’ve long said that the @GlobalFund is one of the kindest things people have ever done for one another. It’s also one of the most effective. Programs supported by the Global Fund have reduced the death toll from AIDS, TB, and malaria by 50%, saving more than 50M lives.
1572663630235312128 2022-09-21 19:06:42 +0000 <BillGates> It was an honor to see you this morning. Supporting @globalfund builds a healthier, safer world – it’s the kindest thing we can do for one another.
1572553155724058629 2022-09-21 11:47:43 +0000 <BillGates> What a night. It’s rare to have so many heroes in one place. #Goalkeepers2030  https://t.co/tvUggVtbBW

1572302755364208640 2022-09-20 19:12:43 +0000 <BillGates> One of my favorite things about Bono is that he loves a good surprise. We had the chance to “photobomb” @ONEinAmerica activists, hear their @GlobalFund campaign stories, and share the latest progress in malaria research. #FightForWhatCounts  https://t.co/jgGxRW5GSi
1572252495853899778 2022-09-20 15:53:00 +0000 <BillGates> For the first time since 2019, the Goalkeepers community is coming together in person. I’m excited to spend time with them and hear about their innovative work to drive progress. #Goalkeepers2030  https://t.co/u8QBxRnXeX

1570495789990019072 2022-09-15 19:32:29 +0000 <BillGates> New ways to prevent and treat malaria are within reach. They’ll make it possible—with the right funding and commitment—to end malaria.  https://t.co/RfsEYuzyCs
1570495788425564160 2022-09-15 19:32:29 +0000 <BillGates> Providing aid to hungry communities is essential—but it’s not enough to end food insecurity. We also need innovation to create self-sustaining food systems.  https://t.co/F2HYyiXhYA
1570495787049811968 2022-09-15 19:32:28 +0000 <BillGates> Economic inequality is one of the biggest barriers to gender equality. True equality depends not only on a woman’s ability to access money, but also on her ability to fully control it.  https://t.co/Bd5V1kTZAx
1570495785208520705 2022-09-15 19:32:28 +0000 <BillGates> Seven years ago, world leaders agreed to 17 ambitious goals to reduce inequality by 2030. The 2022 Goalkeepers report is an essential update on the progress. #Goalkeepers2030  https://t.co/LhoIfyZrxQ

1569125875928698880 2022-09-12 00:48:56 +0000 <BillGates> Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children under 5. Inventprise is working to change that:  https://t.co/jRSjceEhOb  https://t.co/ePrWNxUC08

1563554181943660544 2022-08-27 15:49:01 +0000 <BillGates> We’re so grateful for Japan’s generosity. We all have a part to play in the #FightForWhatCounts: ending AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria and building resilient health systems that will keep us safe from future pandemics.
1563209649364430849 2022-08-26 16:59:58 +0000 <BillGates> Interesting findings from @zearned on how to tackle learning disruptions from COVID-19 and help all kids move forward in their math learning.  https://t.co/kjthRco0bl
1562905011868545024 2022-08-25 20:49:26 +0000 <BillGates> It’s encouraging that there’s more public support for taking big steps to avoid a climate disaster than ever before. My book suggests a lot of ideas – and it’s now available in paperback:  https://t.co/PpoWh22buC  https://t.co/Un1BME9sst
1562845130436255745 2022-08-25 16:51:30 +0000 <BillGates> It’s easy to forget how scary polio was in the United States and around the world. This is a powerful reminder.  https://t.co/P22TxXJEW4

1562189099355627521 2022-08-23 21:24:40 +0000 <BillGates> I cannot agree with @Dr_HamidJafari more: women vaccinators are vitally important in reaching every last child with polio vaccines. Thank you to @JenJonesRotary and everyone in the @Rotary  community for continuing to support the effort to #EndPolio for good.

1561456578007408640 2022-08-21 20:53:53 +0000 <BillGates> Years ago, the idea of using mosquitoes as an ally in the fight against diseases sounded crazy. But as @ScottLOneill of @WMPglobal explains, this innovative solution has already saved lives around the world.  https://t.co/19iMfLrLxB
1560771328814108673 2022-08-19 23:30:57 +0000 <BillGates> I’m at my happiest when I’m learning – no matter how gross the subject matter. Today, I experienced the Meguro Parasitological Museum in Tokyo, and saw what is believed to be the world’s longest tapeworm. 10/10 would visit again.  https://t.co/pMsHSswSBM
1560672267515809792 2022-08-19 16:57:19 +0000 <BillGates> I am honored to receive this award. Thank you, Foreign Minister Hayashi.

India's progress in these sectors is inspiring and we are fortunate to partner in this journey #AmritMahotsav
1558213819209371648 2022-08-12 22:08:19 +0000 <BillGates> While our fight against climate change is far from over, I’m more optimistic than ever that by working together, we can make a net-zero future of abundant, affordable, and clean energy a reality to people everywhere.
1558213815975571456 2022-08-12 22:08:18 +0000 <BillGates> This $369 billion investment will spark innovation, drive job creation, and reduce energy prices and emissions. It sets a clear example of what serious climate action looks like.
1558213811680595969 2022-08-12 22:08:17 +0000 <BillGates> The Inflation Reduction Act’s passage through Congress is nothing short of extraordinary. The United States is taking a historic step towards the clean energy economy we need to meet our climate goals.

1550178154806796288 2022-07-21 17:57:27 +0000 <BillGates> This is heartbreaking. The world had made so much progress before COVID. There’s a lot of work ahead to get back to, and eventually exceed, pre-pandemic vaccination levels.  https://t.co/2TVuypQjod

1548868571639562241 2022-07-18 03:13:38 +0000 <BillGates> Mr. Mandela exemplified how we can fight for progress, diminish stigmas, and spread hope. He played a crucial role in the progress we have made so far against HIV/AIDs. I will never forget the example that he set.
1548868568476893185 2022-07-18 03:13:37 +0000 <BillGates> This is one of my favorite photos ever. My dad, Mr. Mandela, and President Jimmy Carter hold infants born with HIV to dismiss the fear and stigma around touching people who live with the disease.  https://t.co/uD91AEVHsf

1547235395078803457 2022-07-13 15:03:59 +0000 <BillGates> I have an obligation to return my resources to society in ways that have the greatest impact for reducing suffering and improving lives. And I hope others in positions of great wealth and privilege will step up in this moment too.
1547235392721629185 2022-07-13 15:03:58 +0000 <BillGates> As I look to the future, I plan to give virtually all of my wealth to the foundation. I will move down and eventually off of the list of the world’s richest people.
1547235390779641857 2022-07-13 15:03:58 +0000 <BillGates> Although the foundation bears our names, basically half our resources have come from Warren Buffett. His incredible generosity is a huge reason why the foundation has been able to be so ambitious. I can never adequately express how much I appreciate his friendship and guidance.  https://t.co/at7MvJKxQv
1547235388594331648 2022-07-13 15:03:57 +0000 <BillGates> I am very proud of the foundation’s role in helping solve big problems like preventing pandemics, reducing childhood deaths, eradicating diseases, improving food security and climate adaptation, achieving gender equality, and improving educational outcomes. https://t.co/D8rJrdoPOE
1547235386560155648 2022-07-13 15:03:57 +0000 <BillGates> With the support and guidance of our board, we plan to increase our spending from nearly $6 billion per year today to $9 billion per year by 2026. To help make this spending increase possible, I am transferring $20 billion to the foundation’s endowment this month.  https://t.co/ybLMAKPx7I
1547235384303620104 2022-07-13 15:03:56 +0000 <BillGates> Melinda and I started the @gatesfoundation in 2000 because we believed that every person should have the chance to live a healthy and productive life. That vision remains the same, but the great crises of our time require all of us to do more.  https://t.co/QBT6FHMqEj
1547235382118346759 2022-07-13 15:03:55 +0000 <BillGates> But I’m still optimistic. These setbacks are happening in the context of two decades’ worth of historic progress and I believe it is possible to mitigate the damage and get back to the progress the world was making.
1547235379828310017 2022-07-13 15:03:55 +0000 <BillGates> The pandemic is one of the biggest setbacks in history. The war on Ukraine is a gigantic tragedy for the entire world. The damage from climate change is already worse than most models predicted. The U.S. has taken a huge step backwards for gender equality and women’s health.
1547235377773088768 2022-07-13 15:03:54 +0000 <BillGates> Several huge global setbacks over the past few years have left many people discouraged and wondering whether the world is destined to get worse.
1546891510649462784 2022-07-12 16:17:30 +0000 <BillGates> When I was 13, computer science changed the course of my life. I was really lucky to have access to a computer that early on. I hope this initiative will give every student the same opportunity.
1546602943041785857 2022-07-11 21:10:50 +0000 <BillGates> Fusion will need to be an important part of our zero-emissions future. That’s why the work that @energy_zap does is so exciting.  https://t.co/JTYJuKJtwt
1545843628953649152 2022-07-09 18:53:36 +0000 <BillGates> If you’re a big tennis fan like I am, @devisridhar’s profile on Althea Gibson is a grand slam. She was the first Black player to win Wimbledon.  https://t.co/8wUBjNgsTL
1545468086664708096 2022-07-08 18:01:19 +0000 <BillGates> Prime Minister Abe was a friend and partner of our foundation who helped save lives around the world by championing universal health coverage and programs like the Global Fund. I’m shocked and saddened by his death.
1545159210312167424 2022-07-07 21:33:58 +0000 <BillGates> Happy 10th birthday to CRISPR, one of the most important inventions in medicine, biology, and agriculture.  https://t.co/t0B0ctWPos

1542916583651037184 2022-07-01 17:02:34 +0000 <BillGates> I got to join the @Breakthrough team to talk about the incredible work they’re doing to accelerate climate innovation. I’m lucky to work with such smart and dedicated individuals.  https://t.co/cNe6QwfmOb
1542619180653916160 2022-06-30 21:20:47 +0000 <BillGates> Today’s ruling makes it more challenging for the US to hit its climate goals. It’s now more important than ever for Congress to level the playing field for clean technologies.
1542543684842840064 2022-06-30 16:20:48 +0000 <BillGates> Being in New York is always fun – you never know who you’ll run into. It was great meeting you and Namrata!

1541992366000615425 2022-06-29 03:50:03 +0000 <BillGates> It’s great to see countries and partners jointly sign the Kigali Declaration. It wouldn't have been possible without Kigali Summit hosts @RwandaGov, @CombatNTDs &amp; @endmalaria, @WHO facilitators &amp; key donors like President @mohamedbinzayed whose commitment help advance the fight.
1541992362322276353 2022-06-29 03:50:02 +0000 <BillGates> 1.7 billion people are affected by debilitating Neglected Tropical Diseases. Thankfully, an extraordinary public private partnership, and the donation of over 14 billion drugs, has meant that we're a step closer to a future where NTDs are #NeglectedNoMore.  https://t.co/OhuR3Q4NOs

1541477546088202240 2022-06-27 17:44:20 +0000 <BillGates> If you want to understand what’s going on with politics in the United States, Why We’re Polarized by @ezraklein is the book to pick up.  https://t.co/rkDceLlCKT
1540365878272790528 2022-06-24 16:06:58 +0000 <BillGates> This is a sad day. Reversing Roe v. Wade is an unjust and unacceptable setback. And it puts women’s lives at risk, especially the most disadvantaged.
1540021592842899458 2022-06-23 17:18:54 +0000 <BillGates> Through renewed investments in malaria and NTDs, we can help end these endemic diseases, and prevent future pandemics.
1539765368821932032 2022-06-23 00:20:46 +0000 <BillGates> Daniel Boakye of @TheENDFund has spent 45 years working on solutions for neglected tropical diseases, including river blindness. As he says, “We have the tools we need. The priority now is to deploy them in the right way to get to elimination.”  https://t.co/Mzdh5sOoCr
1539702524101292032 2022-06-22 20:11:02 +0000 <BillGates> When most people think about what produces greenhouse gas emissions, they think about cars and electricity. But they add up to only about one third of the total. Clean hydrogen could help eliminate the rest:  https://t.co/CtB8gnMB2Z  https://t.co/WUocOWxKcr

1537862941822705664 2022-06-17 18:21:12 +0000 <BillGates> My advice is simple: read a lot and discover a skill you enjoy. For some, that means being great at science or a great communicator. There’s so much opportunity to do good in the world.
1537862939654311937 2022-06-17 18:21:11 +0000 <BillGates> I was recently asked what advice I would give to young people who want to make a positive impact on the world.
1537481132354088960 2022-06-16 17:04:01 +0000 <BillGates> What a great meeting with WA’s teacher of the year, Jared Koepp. He taught me a lot about the challenges that Native students face.  https://t.co/WBPqJuPqm1

1537180566558150656 2022-06-15 21:09:41 +0000 <BillGates> @jaramillogroup Very cool to hear about all your exciting research. Thanks for letting me be a jaramigo for the day!
1537180422802509824 2022-06-15 21:09:06 +0000 <BillGates> @TheChemEngineer @gatesfoundation It was great to meet you yesterday!
1536847518511685632 2022-06-14 23:06:16 +0000 <BillGates> I’m grateful for Warren’s gifts to support the foundation’s work and for our many years of friendship. When he decided in 2006 to make these gifts, it moved me to tears. It still does.
1536518063079583744 2022-06-14 01:17:08 +0000 <BillGates> The fact is, we’ve never been closer to ending polio. The huge progress Pakistan has made in the fight against polio is a reminder for why the world cannot lose sight of this goal.  https://t.co/TRobY770WZ
1536404118318858240 2022-06-13 17:44:21 +0000 <BillGates> It really is mind-blowing how quickly safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines were made:  https://t.co/al6j8osekU  https://t.co/2ejR43pUZL

1535685018424516609 2022-06-11 18:06:54 +0000 <BillGates> Multiple people told me to read The Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson and I’m glad I listened – it’s terrific. Robinson presents a stimulating story on climate change, spanning decades and continents. It's packed with fascinating ideas:  https://t.co/7N2z2hZtOz  https://t.co/Ei0QyzBUUc
1535684942843129856 2022-06-11 18:06:36 +0000 <BillGates> I’ve been a fan of @amortowles for a few years now and his recent novel The Lincoln Highway is fantastic. Set in 1954, he uses the story of two brothers to show that our personal journeys are never as linear or predictable as we might hope:  https://t.co/3yfrJ5mgui  https://t.co/4vw6IvbLFf
1535684864896139265 2022-06-11 18:06:18 +0000 <BillGates> .@ezraklein's Why We’re Polarized is a fascinating look at human psychology. He argues that the increasing polarization in America stems from identity—the human instinct to let our group identities guide our decision-making:  https://t.co/PHU4pQK555  https://t.co/Nrn9K7MtYk
1535684801138569216 2022-06-11 18:06:02 +0000 <BillGates> I’m glad that I followed @jenngates1996’s recommendation for The Power by @NaomiAllthenews. I gained a more visceral sense of the abuse and injustice women experience today.

1535684797426565120 2022-06-11 18:06:02 +0000 <BillGates> I recently published a list of books you might want to read this summer. Each of the writers took a meaty subject and made it compelling without sacrificing any complexity:  https://t.co/8fDkR0IWaj  https://t.co/Wzqrjbpd9D

1532036952630784001 2022-06-01 16:30:48 +0000 <BillGates> Just like we have a robust system to prevent and extinguish fires, there needs to be an equally effective system to identify and respond to disease outbreaks.

1529493838665945089 2022-05-25 16:05:22 +0000 <BillGates> The school shooting in Texas is heartbreaking. No parent should worry that their child isn’t safe at school. We must come together and act now so this never happens again.

1524142710994571264 2022-05-10 21:41:54 +0000 <BillGates> The Gates Foundation is coming together today for the first time in two years, and I am lucky to be on Teams to see everyone and thank them for their hard work.
1524142709853720576 2022-05-10 21:41:53 +0000 <BillGates> I'm fortunate to be vaccinated and boosted and have access to testing and great medical care.
1524142708628934656 2022-05-10 21:41:53 +0000 <BillGates> I've tested positive for COVID. I'm experiencing mild symptoms and am following the experts' advice by isolating until I'm healthy again.
1524115800591724545 2022-05-10 19:54:58 +0000 <BillGates> World-changing ideas require bold thinkers and doers to transform them into reality. These new Advisory Group members for the @gatesfoundation’s Goalkeepers initiative are changing the world.  https://t.co/xkzo8ot48W
1522980714920128512 2022-05-07 16:44:32 +0000 <BillGates> Katalin Kariko (@kkariko) saw the potential of mRNA to save lives when few others did–and she was willing to fight tooth and nail to pursue it:  https://t.co/NLmWgQM8Lc  https://t.co/tX6qquOe5N

1522711362010451968 2022-05-06 22:54:13 +0000 <BillGates> John’s leadership at @AfricaCDC has been remarkable – especially during the last two years. @PEPFAR’s work has saved tens of millions of lives, and there are many reasons to be hopeful about HIV prevention and treatment in the future.
1522623458869350400 2022-05-06 17:04:56 +0000 <BillGates> If we’re going to prevent the next pandemic, the world needs the infectious disease equivalent of firefighters. Also in this video: a cute puppy.  https://t.co/KDg2650nhe

1521468720882745344 2022-05-03 12:36:25 +0000 <BillGates> I was shocked to wake up to the news this morning. A reversal of Roe v. Wade would set us back 50 years and disproportionately impact the most vulnerable women in society.  I support a woman's right to make their own decisions about their health care.
1521312855127076864 2022-05-03 02:17:03 +0000 <BillGates> My new book comes out tomorrow – but @GatesNotes Insiders can get an early sneak peek and download a free chapter now:  https://t.co/6cQv2FwB4W  https://t.co/QwbjHOnywy
1521240499830476800 2022-05-02 21:29:33 +0000 <BillGates> No one wants to live through this again – and we don’t have to. As @larrybrilliant says: Outbreaks are inevitable, but pandemics are optional.  https://t.co/RSdJCbDyd3

1520137476911763456 2022-04-29 20:26:31 +0000 <BillGates> To avoid another COVID-19 – or worse – the world needs a full-time, paid team whose entire job is to prevent pandemics. I call it GERM:  https://t.co/jvpjjg1jUY

1519363415982059520 2022-04-27 17:10:41 +0000 <BillGates> Giving a TED talk is always a memorable (and nerve-wracking!) experience. Beyond the talk, I also got to listen to the stories of frontline workers and catch up with some of the people working to make the world a more equitable place:  https://t.co/dTRJk1uJGM

1518712769196961792 2022-04-25 22:05:15 +0000 <BillGates> Building a software company is nothing compared to building a Roman fire bucket. I tried my hand at it for my latest TED Talk:  https://t.co/kKsR0yKIhV  https://t.co/cV9lphEFtO
1518687917526315009 2022-04-25 20:26:30 +0000 <BillGates> The Global Fund is one of the kindest things people have ever done for one another. Replenishing it will lower malaria cases by almost two thirds in just four years, strengthen health systems, and help ensure COVID-19 is the last pandemic. #WorldMalariaDay
1517890116898885634 2022-04-23 15:36:19 +0000 <BillGates> Happy World Book Day! I try to read every day, whether I have a busy day at the office or am out for a hike. It’s one of my favorite ways to learn new things and better understand the world.  https://t.co/cW71Lsv8Zr
1517550507019046913 2022-04-22 17:06:50 +0000 <BillGates> Seven years ago, I gave a TED Talk about how the world wasn’t ready for the next epidemic. A lot has changed since then:  https://t.co/3oT8MJIYrO

1516919058024714240 2022-04-20 23:17:41 +0000 <BillGates> One of the surprises of the pandemic is how long it took to develop effective treatments—few people thought there would be vaccines before COVID medicines. In this first excerpt from my new book I suggest ways to speed things up during future outbreaks.  https://t.co/ShtJkmrPbC

1515030671042830339 2022-04-15 18:13:54 +0000 <BillGates> One of the best parts of my job is learning from innovators and entrepreneurs taking on some of the world's greatest challenges. They make me optimistic about the world’s ability to get to net-zero carbon emissions:  https://t.co/1wNjdBJOlJ
1514700859082362880 2022-04-14 20:23:21 +0000 <BillGates> Preventing the next pandemic is not cheap, but it'll save lives and money in the long run. The IMF estimates that COVID will cost nearly $14 trillion. We can save trillions by spending billions.
1514374717771112448 2022-04-13 22:47:23 +0000 <BillGates> This week, I got to do what every nerd dreams of – talk about ideas and learn from others doing big things.

1488195516567482369 2022-01-31 17:00:35 +0000 <BillGates> Significant climate progress is possible in 2022 if we commit to bold action. With the support of our growing community of @Breakthrough Energy partners, we can accelerate the commercialization of the critical climate technologies we need to spark the green industrial revolution.
1487943305727918081 2022-01-31 00:18:23 +0000 <BillGates> The London Declaration on NTDs helped dozens of countries eliminate diseases &amp; reach hundreds of millions more people with treatments. On #WorldNTDDay I welcome the Kigali Declaration to build on this success through strong country leadership.
1487182374727155715 2022-01-28 21:54:43 +0000 <BillGates> Strengthening health systems is critical to preventing future pandemics. @exemplarshealth shows how countries like Senegal and India are building resilient health infrastructures.  https://t.co/loQ6R8kzY0
1486338339997241345 2022-01-26 14:00:49 +0000 <BillGates> We’ve built an incredible organization in the @gatesfoundation over two decades and I’m excited about the next chapter in our history. Our new board members will help us build a world where every person has an opportunity to lead a healthy, productive life  https://t.co/EHJwqUOAPa  https://t.co/e4mgv1MMaN
1486104707722407938 2022-01-25 22:32:27 +0000 <BillGates> Kakenya Ntaiya bravely defied local traditions to make a different plan for her future and her community. In a society where young girls’ lives are often decided for them, she founded @KakenyasDream to educate girls and end practices like child marriage:  https://t.co/ydgG43PCY3  https://t.co/gCx9TKfhUo
1485687499158536193 2022-01-24 18:54:37 +0000 <BillGates> One person’s act of bravery can spark dramatic change in hundreds of lives. @KakenyaN’s story is a powerful example.  https://t.co/jfqLInI7Me
1485388261136556035 2022-01-23 23:05:33 +0000 <BillGates> This is an important reminder from @rajpanjabi. The world should not have to choose between saving lives from COVID-19 and saving lives from malaria. It’s possible to do both.
1484575054482456576 2022-01-21 17:14:09 +0000 <BillGates> I wholeheartedly agree with Larry's view that all companies need to be actively preparing for their net zero transition - shareholders, employees, customers, communities, and regulators expect it.
1484049313483214848 2022-01-20 06:25:03 +0000 <BillGates> European Commissioner @SKyriakidesEU and I discussed the importance of multilateral partnerships like @CEPIvaccines in ending this pandemic and preventing another.  https://t.co/NGk7eFpul7
1483941466670252032 2022-01-19 23:16:30 +0000 <BillGates> To have any hope of reaching net zero and halting the progress of climate change, we need deep and comprehensive collaboration between the public and private sectors worldwide. I was encouraged by today’s discussions about how to accelerate innovation.  https://t.co/VHFFOSykZk
1483664088735514624 2022-01-19 04:54:18 +0000 <BillGates> The omicron surge is an unfortunate reminder that the only way to eliminate the threat of COVID-19 somewhere is to eliminate it everywhere. That’s why @gatesfoundation is joining @wellcometrust to renew our investment in @CEPIvaccines.  https://t.co/flVoKq3H3l
1483487041677524994 2022-01-18 17:10:47 +0000 <BillGates> Genomic sequencing is a critical tool that will help us fight COVID-19 and prevent the next pandemic.  https://t.co/lCP74qexkB
1481785879068692483 2022-01-14 00:30:58 +0000 <BillGates> The fight to eradicate HIV is far from over, but incredible progress has been made through scientific innovation, activism, and collective global action. These lessons provide a path forward with COVID-19 and hope for preventing the next pandemic.  https://t.co/ztb8d6BHZP
1481440812252598280 2022-01-13 01:39:48 +0000 <BillGates> ICYMI here’s a recap of my conversation with @devisridhar. We chatted about this pandemic, how to prevent the next one, and a few things in between.  https://t.co/UKOGoXm9EL
1481053000517185536 2022-01-11 23:58:46 +0000 <BillGates> Thanks @devisridhar for taking the time today to discuss omicron, vaccines, and how the world can come together to prevent the next pandemic.
1480978019829256192 2022-01-11 19:00:49 +0000 <BillGates> @devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov @trvrb .@DrTedros  has started the conversation about how we avoid the next pandemic which is important. I appreciate your work on this. We can do a lot better next time!!#
1480977403270762496 2022-01-11 18:58:22 +0000 <BillGates> @devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov A more transmissive variant is not likely but we have been surprised a lot during this pandemic. Omicron will create a lot of immunity at least for the next year. @trvrb  tracks the genetics really well. We may have to take yearly shots for Covid for some time.
1480976747440984067 2022-01-11 18:55:46 +0000 <BillGates> @devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov As countries experience their Omicron wave health systems will be challenged. Most of the severe cases will be unvaccinated people. Once Omicron goes through a country then the rest of the year should see far fewer cases so Covid can be treated more like seasonal flu.
1480975779403997186 2022-01-11 18:51:55 +0000 <BillGates> @devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov The data is pretty strong that it came from another species which is true for most pandemics. People will continue to speculate on this and we should make sure labs are careful. There will be future outbreaks coming from other species so we need to invest in being ready. #
1480974345585377283 2022-01-11 18:46:13 +0000 <BillGates> @devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov From 2000 to the start of the pandemic we made strong progress on health and other goals. The pandemic is a huge setback - including rich countries not focusing on the needs of developing countries as much. I hope we can reverse that.
1480973364080435205 2022-01-11 18:42:19 +0000 <BillGates> @devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov People like you and I and Tony Fauci have been subject to a lot of misinformation. I didn't expect that. Some of it like me putting chips in arms doesn't make sense to me - why would I want to do that?#
1480972904560934912 2022-01-11 18:40:30 +0000 <BillGates> @devisridhar @gavi Trusted authorities like @WHO  and @CDCgov need more resources to see the pandemic early (surveillance) and to communicate better. Social media got behind on trying to get factual information out - there will be a lot of debate about how to do better on that...
1480971375560986624 2022-01-11 18:34:25 +0000 <BillGates> @devisridhar @gavi Do you think the world will come together to get ready for the next one? I hope so but I am not sure.#
1480971089194860545 2022-01-11 18:33:17 +0000 <BillGates> @devisridhar @gavi Also some countries did a better job of reducing mobility, using masks and protecting the elderly.  We weren't prepared - no practice in advance.#
1480970884307247104 2022-01-11 18:32:28 +0000 <BillGates> @devisridhar @gavi A few countries like Australia moved fast to diagnose cases at scale and isolate people who were infected. They were able to limit deaths dramatically. Once the numbers get large in a country it is too late. So the first few months made a lot of difference.
1480969993944584198 2022-01-11 18:28:56 +0000 <BillGates> @devisridhar When we have adequate supply then tiered pricing is used where the rich countries pay a lot more than middle income and low income pay the least which is funded by @gavi. When supply is limited rich countries have to not outbid the others so governments are key to this. #
1480968984514023428 2022-01-11 18:24:55 +0000 <BillGates> @devisridhar mRna vaccines still can't meet all the demand so figuring out who gets what is complicated.#
1480968692401782788 2022-01-11 18:23:45 +0000 <BillGates> @devisridhar During 2021 the supply of vaccines was limited and they mostly went to wealthy countries. Now we have a lot of supply overall and the problems are logistics and demand. The health systems in developing countries are a limiting factor.
1480967846607736832 2022-01-11 18:20:24 +0000 <BillGates> @devisridhar The vaccines we have prevent severe disease and death very well but they are missing two key things.  First they still allow infections ("breakthrough") and the duration appears to be limited.  We need vaccines that prevent re-infection and have many years of duration.#
1480961918047186948 2022-01-11 17:56:50 +0000 <BillGates> I'm excited to talk with @DeviSridhar today about her work at the University of Edinburgh Medical School and @GlobalHealthGP, and to answer some of your questions about what we’ve been learning recently about the pandemic. #
1480961916268789760 2022-01-11 17:56:50 +0000 <BillGates> Through my foundation work I'm very lucky to have the opportunity to talk to—and learn from—experts in many different fields. Many of my conversations recently have been about the omicron variant and how to prevent the next pandemic.
1479537175662313479 2022-01-07 19:35:25 +0000 <BillGates> Understanding how the connections in our brains give rise to consciousness and our ability to learn may help lead to great breakthroughs in the way we solve the world’s hardest problems. This is one of the most fascinating books I read this year.  https://t.co/UaSQV1jbBg
1475599822019121152 2021-12-27 22:49:47 +0000 <BillGates> We have some, but not all, of the tools we need to hit our target of limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees. We need to prioritize closing that gap if we’re going to avoid a climate disaster:  https://t.co/h6wqiZVgph  https://t.co/Mj3df3OVl0
1475173144633610243 2021-12-26 18:34:19 +0000 <BillGates> The world has lost a hero. Archbishop Desmond Tutu led with his values, empathy and optimism. He put everyone he met at ease with his incredible laugh and energy. He inspired me with his sense of purpose to build peace out of the struggle of oppression. I will miss him greatly.
1474175674185228291 2021-12-24 00:30:44 +0000 <BillGates> One of my favorite holiday traditions is sharing books with family and friends. Here are 5 books I loved reading this year:  https://t.co/lhvffVsmgC
1473822331344605184 2021-12-23 01:06:40 +0000 <BillGates> Mamello Makhele is a hero from Lesotho who traveled by foot and donkey to bring health services to women in need during the pandemic. Her story is nothing short of inspiring:  https://t.co/UyI4x0VxhK  https://t.co/3MLP5nvm5l
1473334003973324801 2021-12-21 16:46:14 +0000 <BillGates> I know it’s frustrating to go into another holiday season with COVID looming over us. But it won’t be like this forever. Someday the pandemic will end, and the better we look after each other, the sooner that time will come.
1473334002903777281 2021-12-21 16:46:14 +0000 <BillGates> If there’s good news here, it’s that omicron moves so quickly that once it becomes dominant in a country, the wave there should last less than 3 months. Those few months could be bad, but I still believe if we take the right steps, the pandemic can be over in 2022.
1473334001821650948 2021-12-21 16:46:13 +0000 <BillGates> There will be more breakthrough cases in people who are vx’d, which sounds concerning but is purely a factor of how many people are vx’d and how fast this variant is spreading. Vaccines are designed to prevent people from getting seriously ill or dying &amp; are doing that well.
1473334000622063620 2021-12-21 16:46:13 +0000 <BillGates> In the meantime, we all have to look out for each other, especially the most vulnerable, whether they live down the street or in another country. That means wearing masks, avoiding big indoor gatherings, and getting vaccinated. Getting a booster gives the best protection.
1473333999493779461 2021-12-21 16:46:13 +0000 <BillGates> The big unknown is how sick omicron makes you. We need to take it seriously until we know more about it. Even if it’s only half as severe as delta, it will be the worst surge we have seen so far because it’s so infectious.
1473333998340300804 2021-12-21 16:46:13 +0000 <BillGates> Omicron is spreading faster than any virus in history. It will soon be in every country in the world.
1473333996868149248 2021-12-21 16:46:12 +0000 <BillGates> Just when it seemed like life would return to normal, we could be entering the worst part of the pandemic. Omicron will hit home for all of us. Close friends of mine now have it, and I’ve canceled most of my holiday plans.
1472256526454702081 2021-12-18 17:24:43 +0000 <BillGates> In Tanzania, health workers and community members are serving as disease detectives with a new app called Afyadata:  https://t.co/OFv7JDpQNZ  https://t.co/Yww8sjnYbB
1470901274627358720 2021-12-14 23:39:26 +0000 <BillGates> I spoke to Prime Minister @Kishida230 about his new global health strategy and Japan’s commitment to the world’s poorest people. I’m encouraged to see this pledge and Japan’s recent leadership of the @WBG_IDA and Nutrition for Growth summits.  https://t.co/7KsiYg4lcy
1469355904994734080 2021-12-10 17:18:41 +0000 <BillGates> The Omicron variant is concerning, but the world is better prepared to tackle potentially bad variants than at any other point in the pandemic. Here’s why I’m still hopeful the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is finally in sight:  https://t.co/4GVMtiZsuv  https://t.co/03y1Or6Ge3
1469011614049337345 2021-12-09 18:30:36 +0000 <BillGates> Great to meet with @MohamedbinZayed again to recognize Niger’s progress in the fight against neglected tropical diseases. His commitment to this fight, to polio eradication and to disease elimination at large will help save millions of lives.
1468955190548066318 2021-12-09 14:46:23 +0000 <BillGates> This order signed by President Biden signals a strong commitment to deploying the solutions we need to get to net-zero and avoid a climate disaster.   https://t.co/PlOfS1L3ih
1468664794567700483 2021-12-08 19:32:28 +0000 <BillGates> 2021 was an incredibly hard year for many people, including me, but there are reasons to be optimistic that 2022 will be better:  https://t.co/BxF6Q4K9Mq  https://t.co/C0SdhYxKg8
1468611799545044992 2021-12-08 16:01:53 +0000 <BillGates> Better nutrition can lead to shifts in health and productivity—boosting prosperity for families, communities, and economies. At the N4G2021 in Tokyo, I announced our support for @UNICEF’s nutrition fund to ensure tools to combat malnutrition are available to those in need.
1468282157659394055 2021-12-07 18:12:00 +0000 <BillGates> 2021 has been a year of big transitions for me, but it hasn’t changed why I love the work I do. Here are four things I’m thinking about heading into next year.  https://t.co/z8TvzoJGsJ
1467882292827721730 2021-12-06 15:43:05 +0000 <BillGates> The groundbreaking RTS,S vaccine will help save tens of thousands of children and is paving the way for a new pipeline of tools to #EndMalaria.  https://t.co/IKnNlwHuPP
1467657732014497793 2021-12-06 00:50:45 +0000 <BillGates> Robots will play a huge part in our future, and fiction like Kazuo Ishiguro's Klara and the Sun is a great way to explore what that might mean.  https://t.co/qlotAHk0ST
1465778366707998721 2021-11-30 20:22:50 +0000 <BillGates> Accelerating long-duration energy storage innovation can significantly reduce annual CO2 emissions and lay the foundation for a net-zero economy by 2050.
1465445663353688066 2021-11-29 22:20:47 +0000 <BillGates> The @gatesfoundation is supporting GIISER which is working to increase the in-country capacity for rapid evaluation of variants on the African continent. This will help us better understand variants of concern and how the current vaccines may perform.  https://t.co/yz9XWS4LWH
1465445661755666433 2021-11-29 22:20:47 +0000 <BillGates> South Africa did the right thing by reporting these cases. They have invested heavily in R&amp;D including genomic sequencing capabilities which have made it possible to quickly identify variants, like Omicron, and help the world respond appropriately.
1465445659813691394 2021-11-29 22:20:46 +0000 <BillGates> Experts like Trevor Bedford have done an excellent job explaining what scientists have learned so far about the new variant of concern known as Omicron.  https://t.co/cix77NasZs
1465445655900348416 2021-11-29 22:20:45 +0000 <BillGates> I made this video a few months ago to help explain what happens when a virus mutates. You can read more about the ways in which new variants are (and aren’t) complicating the pandemic here:  https://t.co/luwOHz0hbJ  https://t.co/l058kxZHgZ
1465143899949731841 2021-11-29 02:21:41 +0000 <BillGates> I usually read a lot of non-fiction books, but lately I’ve found myself drawn back to the kinds of novels I would’ve loved as a kid. These were some of my favorites this year:  https://t.co/ef6sg8MTdV  Which do you like better?
1464659614448771073 2021-11-27 18:17:18 +0000 <BillGates> There’s lots of speculation about what Shakespeare’s life was really like, but we do know that his son died at age 11. Hamnet shares the story of how grief tore the Shakespeare family apart.  https://t.co/KrNPsGvcXv
1464288045541199874 2021-11-26 17:40:49 +0000 <BillGates> When I was a kid, I was obsessed with science fiction. But @andyweirauthor’s latest book Project Hail Mary is a fun read even if you aren’t a sci-fi fan. I finished the whole thing in one weekend.  https://t.co/Ctv8WCNriN
1463528104614236167 2021-11-24 15:21:05 +0000 <BillGates> I read a lot of great books this year. These were some of my favorites.  https://t.co/t5AzHkm1z6
1462583003272474628 2021-11-22 00:45:36 +0000 <BillGates> It’s hard to believe that it’s been 50 years since the 4004 kickstarted the PC era. I still remember reading about its release with Paul and dreaming about how the world's first microprocessor might shape the future.  https://t.co/7MDhGok7t5
1461762358523535360 2021-11-19 18:24:39 +0000 <BillGates> About 3.6 billion people—nearly half of the world’s population—lack toilets or use unsafe sanitation. This #WorldToiletDay, I’m optimistic this sanitation crisis can be solved.  https://t.co/ILNnK3ZkGA
1461470539575218180 2021-11-18 23:05:04 +0000 <BillGates> 2021 saw incredible innovation in health and climate. I am excited about many of these advancements and look forward to seeing what’s next.  https://t.co/kBGnl5KIq8
1461380998743015425 2021-11-18 17:09:15 +0000 <BillGates> I love the message in @JohnDoerr’s new book that in order to eliminate the Green Premiums, we need to make a scalable plan now:  https://t.co/sOJsZ5GTRE  https://t.co/C5UvjbkeiD
1461108508250689537 2021-11-17 23:06:29 +0000 <BillGates> The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is an important step on America’s path to achieving net-zero emissions. But the job is not done. Congress should also pass the Build Back Better Act to help accelerate development of the climate solutions we need.
1461034359582965763 2021-11-17 18:11:50 +0000 <BillGates> Data sharing and global collaboration move us closer to new #Alzheimers diagnostics, treatments, and cures. I’m optimistic about what lies ahead:  https://t.co/SazZfc4H7d
1460734002264883205 2021-11-16 22:18:19 +0000 <BillGates> We still have a lot of work to do, but the conversation I heard at the #COP26 climate summit left me feeling optimistic that we can avoid a climate disaster:  https://t.co/zLtlcPd2Ux  https://t.co/JB3aNbTsAw
1460317599875534848 2021-11-15 18:43:41 +0000 <BillGates> Data on student outcomes can help institutional leaders and policymakers better understand the economic value that colleges deliver to students. This new tool makes that data publicly available—a critical step toward a more equitable higher ed system.
1459937906525556739 2021-11-14 17:34:55 +0000 <BillGates> Poverty and the world’s top global health problems are closely connected. By improving one, we can make progress towards fixing the other:  https://t.co/t439RWZba2  https://t.co/Rcq40MlaXc
1459937855577280514 2021-11-14 17:34:43 +0000 <BillGates> The effects of climate change are affecting many aspects of our lives. By working to minimize its effects, we are also working to improve global health. However, ending malaria needs to (and should) happen faster:  https://t.co/t439RWZba2  https://t.co/jp5OK6SVaC
1459937626341855236 2021-11-14 17:33:49 +0000 <BillGates> Nobody can be an expert in all things at once. To end malaria—or any disease—leaders from around the world need to collaborate to make sustainable progress:  https://t.co/t439RWZba2  https://t.co/il2Q5eRjjR
1459937588421136388 2021-11-14 17:33:40 +0000 <BillGates> I recently had the chance to meet 36 incredible graduate students working to #endmalaria. Here are some of my favorite questions they asked.
1459240086554304517 2021-11-12 19:22:02 +0000 <BillGates> To tackle the biggest global health challenges, all countries must have access to vaccines and other health innovations. This $150M commitment from the foundation and @sida will help low- and middle-income countries get the essential supplies they need.  https://t.co/BHHp2N6mH0
1458501583906295813 2021-11-10 18:27:29 +0000 <BillGates> I recently met with 36 remarkable graduate students who made me more optimistic than ever that we can #EndMalaria.  https://t.co/Sua3bsxuJl
1458448640528183300 2021-11-10 14:57:07 +0000 <BillGates> Many thanks to @YoYo_Ma for helping us spotlight the Grand Challenges in Global Health - and for this beautiful performance with the @gatesfoundation's own Chris Karp. It’s always fun to find out your colleague has a hidden talent.  https://t.co/w4ipdHPtv0
1458196382624276490 2021-11-09 22:14:44 +0000 <BillGates> Setting concrete goals is a critical first step to solving any problem. I’m impressed by @JohnDoerr’s approach to identifying the objectives and key results needed to track our progress on climate.
1458132018135322627 2021-11-09 17:58:58 +0000 <BillGates> COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic threat the world faces. I spoke to the #GrandChallenges community about the ambitious innovation agenda we need to end this crisis and be ready to respond to the next.  https://t.co/VqGYfiOjQ4
1457841063482167302 2021-11-08 22:42:49 +0000 <BillGates> Getting to zero carbon emissions isn’t optional. After #COP26, I am optimistic that we can meet the challenge.  https://t.co/usp4V6VqCK
1456432517427253251 2021-11-05 01:25:46 +0000 <BillGates> Demand for syringes has skyrocketed to deliver the COVID-19 vaccines. Increasing production of auto-disable syringes will help ensure low- and middle-income countries have the tools they need to deliver routine and COVID vaccines.  https://t.co/Acou25JVf5
1456320508882915334 2021-11-04 18:00:41 +0000 <BillGates> Getting to zero emissions will be the hardest thing people have ever done. This was a great conversation about the power of innovation and what the world can accomplish if we work together.
1456291410718511112 2021-11-04 16:05:03 +0000 <BillGates> I was truly inspired to hear @Vinisha27738476 speak at #COP26 this week. Her optimism and passion for innovation makes me hopeful that we can avoid a climate disaster.
1456036362948202498 2021-11-03 23:11:35 +0000 <BillGates> Thank you, @SecGranholm for your leadership. The commitment of @ENERGY and the innovate spirit of our National Labs will drive the breakthroughs we need to help the whole world get to #NetZero.
1456015126935474176 2021-11-03 21:47:12 +0000 <BillGates> Public-private collaborations will be critical to reducing emissions and achieving our 2050 climate goals. Our work with @MICleanEnergyRD will help us do just that.
1456013903599603714 2021-11-03 21:42:20 +0000 <BillGates> I’m excited about @Breakthrough Energy’s expanded work with @MICleanEnergyRD. Thank you, @JonathanWNV for your partnership.
1455681893328850950 2021-11-02 23:43:03 +0000 <BillGates> Thank you, @KensingtonRoyal for your commitment to repairing our planet. It was inspiring to see the ingenuity and innovation of the @EarthshotPrize finalists.
1455660312145715200 2021-11-02 22:17:17 +0000 <BillGates> Great to see @naftalibennett’s commitment alongside global leaders present @COP26 today. The world needs bold action to support the development of new technology to slow emissions and help the world adapt to the changing climate.
1455632027596644354 2021-11-02 20:24:54 +0000 <BillGates> .@Breakthrough Energy Catalyst is bringing together private and public sector leaders to invest in innovation and accelerate clean technologies. @Citi, @IKEAFoundation, and @StateFarm are joining our efforts to help fund solutions that will ignite a green industrial revolution.
1455606254131314688 2021-11-02 18:42:29 +0000 <BillGates> Unless smallholder farmers can adapt to climate change, we will lose the global battle against hunger and poverty. @AIMforClimate is rising to the challenge and supporting major investments in @CGIAR to power agricultural innovation.
1455588313235030018 2021-11-02 17:31:12 +0000 <BillGates> Thank you, @vonderleyen. This $1B partnership between @Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, @EU_Commission, and @EIB will help accelerate the deployment of critical climate technologies. I’m grateful for our continued collaboration.
1455577063822282758 2021-11-02 16:46:29 +0000 <BillGates> Encouraged to discuss with PM @narendramodi on the sidelines of #COP26 the potential of further investments in science, innovation and transformative agriculture R&amp;D as an important foundation for mitigating impact of climate change on small landowning farmers @PMOIndia @nstomar.
1455570288792326153 2021-11-02 16:19:34 +0000 <BillGates> One of my top priorities here at #COP26 is making sure that the world prioritizes scaling clean technology innovation. Here is the message I delivered to world leaders earlier today:  https://t.co/m4mEpj5wIb
1455240228445196291 2021-11-01 18:28:02 +0000 <BillGates> In addition to investments in reducing emissions to slow climate change, we need to help those already impacted by climate change adapt.  https://t.co/4cPN4vxZei
1454902715155316742 2021-10-31 20:06:52 +0000 <BillGates> By bringing the world together at #COP26, we can find more ways to accelerate the development and adoption of the clean technologies we need to reach net-zero emissions.  https://t.co/kIJqTVaOCJ
1454902714014453765 2021-10-31 20:06:52 +0000 <BillGates> At this year’s UN Climate Conference, innovation will take center stage and I’m optimistic about the road ahead.  https://t.co/5kFMgeoo4r
1454823281870004250 2021-10-31 14:51:14 +0000 <BillGates> I hope Congress passes the Build Back Better Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act fast. We can’t wait another moment.  https://t.co/bz1XRoQGnh
1453449405890060289 2021-10-27 19:51:56 +0000 <BillGates> Good to see this commitment by @Merck to help ensure from the outset that molnupiravir, a potential treatment for COVID-19, will be available to many more nations.  https://t.co/5gYFcYtj8a
1453367874848837638 2021-10-27 14:27:58 +0000 <BillGates> To avoid a climate disaster, we need young people’s ideas and energy. College and university students anywhere in the world can download my book for free:  https://t.co/W6cfL580oD  https://t.co/pbKNEwV9WZ
1453003527803052040 2021-10-26 14:20:11 +0000 <BillGates> It’s great to see the strong commitment of partners like @MohamedBinZayed and the dedication on the front line to eradicate polio. On #WorldPolioDay we recognize progress and acknowledge that the fight continues.
1452632195621818373 2021-10-25 13:44:38 +0000 <BillGates> This week, any college or university student anywhere in the world can download my book How to Avoid a Climate Disaster for free.  https://t.co/QvuHREOlx5
1452292976114290705 2021-10-24 15:16:42 +0000 <BillGates> This #WorldPolioDay you can support Shumaila and other polio workers by donating to @Rotary’s fight against polio. Our foundation is giving a 2-to-1 match to every donation. Learn more:  https://t.co/CBDqWHicUa
1452001161603547139 2021-10-23 19:57:08 +0000 <BillGates> The world needs heroes like Shumaila Rehmani. I’m inspired by the impact she’s making in her community to save lives and help #EndPolio.  https://t.co/l1S88506Cm
1451682475676102660 2021-10-22 22:50:47 +0000 <BillGates> I’ve been binging geography videos lately. I liked this one where Geography King explains several really fascinating quirks of US geography (including why it doesn’t actually rain as much as people think in my hometown).  https://t.co/XEoErF60UL
1451417887151779842 2021-10-22 05:19:24 +0000 <BillGates> India has administered 1 billion vaccine doses, a testament to India’s innovation, ability to manufacture at scale, and the efforts of millions of health workers backed by CoWIN. Congratulations @narendramodi @mansukhmandviya @PMOIndia @MoHFW_India  https://t.co/vygRkSkPRm
1451269167231897600 2021-10-21 19:28:27 +0000 <BillGates> The world is so close to ending polio thanks to heroes like Shumaila Rehmani:  https://t.co/PubfuEMuIv #WorldPolioDay  https://t.co/R6bFsfgUHr
1450674444993585165 2021-10-20 04:05:14 +0000 <BillGates> Our funding is only part of the solution. More donors will need to step up to make sure molnupiravir is available to all as quickly as possible.
1450674443840151556 2021-10-20 04:05:14 +0000 <BillGates> Everyone deserves equitable access to healthcare. That’s why we engaged partners like @MedsForAll and @OfficialUoM to find more affordable, safe materials that generic manufacturers can use to produce medicines at a lower cost.
1450674442682523655 2021-10-20 04:05:14 +0000 <BillGates> We’ve done this before. In 2017, the @gatesfoundation worked with partners and generic suppliers to bring improved HIV therapies to more than 18 million people in lower-income countries.
1450674441155846149 2021-10-20 04:05:13 +0000 <BillGates> If we’re going to end the acute phase of the pandemic, life-saving drugs like molnupiravir must be available to everyone who needs them.
1450552465267441667 2021-10-19 20:00:32 +0000 <BillGates> By investing in direct air capture, clean hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, and sustainable aviation fuel, we’ll create a new industrial revolution that will power the global clean energy economy:  https://t.co/NwZZakjhN8
1450552463942062080 2021-10-19 20:00:32 +0000 <BillGates> Earlier today I attended the #GlobalInvestmentSummit where we announced @Breakthrough Energy Catalyst’s latest partnership to accelerate climate technologies. Thanks to the UK government &amp; @10DowningStreet for taking bold action.  https://t.co/ex5nuvrjiF
1450469322883805258 2021-10-19 14:30:09 +0000 <BillGates> I’m grateful to have joined @BorisJohnson today to highlight the important work that @Breakthrough Energy Catalyst is doing to accelerate clean technologies. Our partnership with the UK will be critical to building the net-zero economy.
1450146533073059845 2021-10-18 17:07:30 +0000 <BillGates> Jenn and Nayel, it’s impossible to put into words how happy it makes me to see you filled with joy on your wedding day. I’m so proud of you both for everything you’ve accomplished in your lives so far and everything you will do with your future together.  https://t.co/zXRCKxKSle
1449071773274624004 2021-10-15 17:56:47 +0000 <BillGates> Reaching net zero will take bold action and creativity, and the first cohort of @Breakthrough Energy Fellows makes me optimistic that we can propel a new industrial revolution.  https://t.co/lTI121sg4Y
1448334548152897536 2021-10-13 17:07:19 +0000 <BillGates> I wrote about two ways to achieve vaccine equity in the future. If the world makes the right investments and decisions now, we can make things better next time. And maybe even make sure there is no next time at all.  https://t.co/ZdYHMQt7qP
1448334546445869058 2021-10-13 17:07:19 +0000 <BillGates> Still, the disparities in access to the COVID-19 vaccine are shocking and unjust. Only 2 percent of people in low-income countries have received any COVID-19 vaccines. And the gap may be getting even larger as rich-world governments buy up extra doses to serve as booster shots.
1448334544721960960 2021-10-13 17:07:18 +0000 <BillGates> Inequity in health is not new. Each year, more than 5 million children—almost entirely in low- and middle-income countries—die before their fifth birthday from mostly preventable diseases. Reducing this gap has been the Gates Foundation’s top priority for more than 20 years.
1447969981967204353 2021-10-12 16:58:40 +0000 <BillGates> The pandemic has worsened inequities. But it's also shown the world what's possible when we come together. Read why there's reason to be optimistic in our 2021 Goalkeepers Report.  https://t.co/2XUNjdwCyf
1446116573823967245 2021-10-07 14:13:53 +0000 <BillGates> This work has been critical to our understanding of the causes and impacts of climate change. Congratulations on this well-deserved recognition.  https://t.co/laBJxn25kr
1445902684440068097 2021-10-07 00:03:58 +0000 <BillGates> What a fantastic leader Dr. Collins has been. The U.S. is lucky to have amazing scientists and public health professionals like him. He leaves an incredible legacy.
1445465212774064135 2021-10-05 19:05:36 +0000 <BillGates> Thanks, as always, @zannymb for the thoughtful conversation. I look forward to continuing to talk with business leaders, governments, and activists at #COP26 about how we can work together to avoid a climate disaster.
1444362321309024256 2021-10-02 18:03:07 +0000 <BillGates> No one person can solve climate change on their own. However, if we make breakthroughs in zero-carbon innovations, we can avoid a climate disaster together. Thanks to @Kurz_Gesagt for creating this informative video.
1443992530324844545 2021-10-01 17:33:41 +0000 <BillGates> Happy Birthday, President Carter. You set a great example for all of us, and I am always inspired by your amazing work.  https://t.co/fOQjA5Of0R
1443618257395589146 2021-09-30 16:46:28 +0000 <BillGates> The College @AdvisingCorps is helping students navigate the challenges of continuing their education after high school.  https://t.co/JoWpuUCUwe
1443339404022468611 2021-09-29 22:18:24 +0000 <BillGates> Girin Beeharry was an extraordinary leader and good friend. I’m saddened by his death and inspired by his work to improve lives in India and around the world.
1443253813071077376 2021-09-29 16:38:18 +0000 <BillGates> I’m excited about the launch of @CipherClimate by Breakthrough Energy. The first issue includes an important discussion with U.S. Energy Secretary @SecGranholm and new data showing record amounts of cleantech investment.
1443001944658755597 2021-09-28 23:57:27 +0000 <BillGates> Congratulations @trvrb on this well-deserved recognition. Like you, I’m optimistic that we will be able to bring this pandemic to an end. Your work with the @seattleflustudy and many others will also help us to better prepare for future pandemics.
1442973036081139714 2021-09-28 22:02:35 +0000 <BillGates> Congratulations @narendramodi on the national launch of Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission. This digital health infrastructure will help ensure equitable, accessible healthcare delivery and accelerate progress on India’s health goals. @PMOIndia @MoHFW_INDIA  https://t.co/FbfKyNSfXI
1442517577394098177 2021-09-27 15:52:45 +0000 <BillGates> What if your smart phone could detect Alzheimer’s? @TheADDF's Diagnostics Accelerator is working to make this a reality:  https://t.co/57PSnmrTVR
1441518443895820293 2021-09-24 21:42:33 +0000 <BillGates> India is a great example of a country that has invested in its capacity. Today 2/3rds of all the world's children receive a vaccine that was made in India:  https://t.co/0Ra2PlIQLd
1441518440305487878 2021-09-24 21:42:32 +0000 <BillGates> Expanding the geography of vaccine manufacturing to better meet vaccine needs, both for pandemics and routine immunization, is a critical task.  https://t.co/64gBEEWZLg
1441191677465481222 2021-09-24 00:04:06 +0000 <BillGates> Thanks for having me on the show, @JKCorden! And thanks to the all of the late night hosts for focusing on this critical challenge. I’m optimistic that we can come together to avoid a climate disaster.
1441179318374191106 2021-09-23 23:14:59 +0000 <BillGates> In our recent Goalkeepers report, we share some of the lessons that we’ve learned from the world’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic:  https://t.co/9Ta5hIGRPf
1441176198139170827 2021-09-23 23:02:36 +0000 <BillGates> Thanks for the conversation and for your leadership in helping to end this pandemic and prevent the next one.
1441086893806944270 2021-09-23 17:07:44 +0000 <BillGates> More than 80% of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in high- and upper-middle-income countries while less than 1% have been administered in low-income countries. This is both profoundly unfair and hinders progress towards ending the pandemic:  https://t.co/VXVBKkv7hL  https://t.co/ULaqGJR7Mf
1440874865095942152 2021-09-23 03:05:12 +0000 <BillGates> A global response will help the world end the COVID crisis. I'm glad to see so many leaders coming together at this U.S.-led virtual Global COVID-19 summit, and look forward to their continued efforts to help the world move out of the acute phase of this pandemic.
1440722206351233024 2021-09-22 16:58:35 +0000 <BillGates> Earlier I shared three actions that leaders could take to help the world out of the pandemic. For those who want to go deeper, the @gatesfoundation shares more detail on what’s needed to end this crisis:  https://t.co/1Ftke22T0k
1440508603849273353 2021-09-22 02:49:49 +0000 <BillGates> If we want to stop Alzheimer’s disease, one of the biggest things we need to develop is a reliable, affordable, and accessible diagnostic. Breakthroughs in testing may someday soon let us substantially alter the course of the disease:  https://t.co/l2rq17EsGZ #WorldAlzheimersDay  https://t.co/RLJJQsvDXm
1440440604744249348 2021-09-21 22:19:36 +0000 <BillGates> There are three things that can be done in the coming months to bring an end to the acute phase of the pandemic and set the world on a different timeline in preparation for the next.  https://t.co/41ImCLHpgt
1440094823856291845 2021-09-20 23:25:36 +0000 <BillGates> #WorldAlzheimersDay is an inspiring reminder that hope is on the horizon. Brilliant scientists all over the world are working hard to stop Alzheimer’s disease—and they’re making terrific progress.  https://t.co/BJKp8mJRRt
1439968005467742210 2021-09-20 15:01:40 +0000 <BillGates> Avoiding a climate disaster will require a new industrial revolution. I'm excited to see @Breakthrough Energy Catalyst announce the first private sector anchor partners who will work together to build the clean industries of the future.
1439773362364944392 2021-09-20 02:08:13 +0000 <BillGates> As we’ve seen this past year, new variants of a disease can emerge over time. In order to develop new tools to fight the disease, we need to identify those variants quickly. Dr. Senjuti Saha is one expert working to sequence SARS-CoV-2:  https://t.co/XxexUmVwHo  https://t.co/cEbA3TuEos
1438915048571686914 2021-09-17 17:17:35 +0000 <BillGates> But the fact that we can point to positive signs amid a once-in-a-generation global pandemic is extraordinary. With one hand tied behind their backs, countless individuals, organizations, and countries went above and beyond.  https://t.co/InzRGXGtyc
1438915046613012485 2021-09-17 17:17:35 +0000 <BillGates> Of course, the full extent of the pandemic’s impact on the SDGs will take years to fully understand, as more and better data becomes available. And this data doesn’t diminish the very real suffering the pandemic has caused for people everywhere—far from it.
1438915045203726336 2021-09-17 17:17:35 +0000 <BillGates> Initial projections about the pandemic’s impact on the fight against malaria were dire. But that projection spurred many countries to action to ensure that bed nets were distributed and that testing and antimalarial drugs remained available.
1438915041277857793 2021-09-17 17:17:34 +0000 <BillGates> When the pandemic hit, many feared the worst when it came to maintaining progress on fighting other diseases. But all over the world people stepped up to avert the worst-case scenarios. One example is malaria:  https://t.co/InzRGXGtyc  https://t.co/aM5mszTtWR
1438216750697365506 2021-09-15 19:02:48 +0000 <BillGates> Where you live shouldn’t determine whether or not you have access to a Covid-19 vaccine, health supplies, or a diagnostic test:  https://t.co/DbwClIBRox  https://t.co/eeH7Ezn0Fb
1437817616530227202 2021-09-14 16:36:47 +0000 <BillGates> Even amid the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen that progress can continue thanks to work started years earlier. In this year’s #Goalkeepers2030 report, we share some of the lessons that have inspired all of us at the @gatesfoundation.  https://t.co/pTc6N1cg4J
1437427173174898691 2021-09-13 14:45:18 +0000 <BillGates> This news is not surprising to many of us who work in global health. But there are things the world can do to help get management of these diseases back on track. I’m eager to share more in the annual Goalkeepers report tomorrow.  https://t.co/3Q6QE1prmG #Goalkeepers2030
1436731841893920776 2021-09-11 16:42:18 +0000 <BillGates> I’m thinking today about the frontline heroes who risked their lives for us on September 11th and those who continue to serve our country every day.
1436005956907720704 2021-09-09 16:37:54 +0000 <BillGates> “How do we use technology and innovation to solve today’s problems?” That’s the question David Sengeh, Sierra Leone’s chief innovation officer and education minister, is looking to answer with the country’s National Innovation and Digital Strategy:  https://t.co/btg2gPFI4Q  https://t.co/EV9zh7Lq0x
1435650793080717315 2021-09-08 17:06:36 +0000 <BillGates> The world needs many breakthroughs to get from 51 billion tons of greenhouse gases to zero in order to avoid a climate disaster. It’s encouraging to see this kind of collaboration.
1435355631767080961 2021-09-07 21:33:44 +0000 <BillGates> I found the book to be valuable on a number of levels and will have more to say about it soon!
1435292695652536324 2021-09-07 17:23:39 +0000 <BillGates> The first time I met David Sengeh, I was blown away by his intellect, his ambition, and his sense of humor. He has been a remarkable advocate for Sierra Leone, and I’m confident that we’ll be hearing about @dsengeh’s amazing work for decades to come.  https://t.co/js7uakLj4m
1433896533758410752 2021-09-03 20:55:48 +0000 <BillGates> Africa's success against wild polio last year is one of the most inspiring stories in global health. I’m optimistic that, with the commitment and collaboration that achieved that goal, countries in the region can beat all forms of the virus and #EndPolio  https://t.co/lpJsrhAQcf
1433112909911969793 2021-09-01 17:01:58 +0000 <BillGates> None of us would be where we are today without the incredible teachers who helped shape our perspectives. Brooke Brown is an extraordinary teacher who has helped her students adapt to extraordinary times.  https://t.co/btiQikTyVX
1432809700618211329 2021-08-31 20:57:07 +0000 <BillGates> .@GAP_Foundation’s Bio-Hermes Study is the first to compare results of blood and digital biomarker tests with imaging and traditional cognitive tests. This could help identify Alzheimer’s earlier and detect progression of the disease, to help us get closer to a cure.
1432746395669200896 2021-08-31 16:45:34 +0000 <BillGates> I recently sat down with the extraordinary Brooke Brown, Washington State’s 2021 Teacher of the Year. It was a pleasure to meet with her and take part in one of her favorite lessons:  https://t.co/TAwysEihyQ  https://t.co/rlB1iJjogC
1432365544074723329 2021-08-30 15:32:12 +0000 <BillGates> Happy Birthday, Warren! You’ve been a true friend and an invaluable source of advice over the years, and I’m so lucky to know you. It’s an honor to work at the foundation doing my best to turn your generosity into lives saved and improved. Here’s to many more birthdays!  https://t.co/ZaCGW5KCWm
1431674157306056707 2021-08-28 17:44:52 +0000 <BillGates> Investments in malaria programs help build stronger health systems that will not only bring an end to malaria but also protect us from the next pandemic. Here’s how:  https://t.co/jdMgfMruYZ #MosquitoWeek  https://t.co/gLHSY7Nqcz
1431389983164616705 2021-08-27 22:55:40 +0000 <BillGates> Congratulations, India, on reaching this tremendous milestone. The collective efforts of the government, R&amp;D community, vaccine manufacturers, and millions of health workers have made this feat possible. @PMOIndia @MoHFW_INDIA  https://t.co/cmvQiAfSZG
1430921737307267079 2021-08-26 15:55:02 +0000 <BillGates> The COVID-19 pandemic reminds us why eradicating malaria is essential. Many of the building blocks we need to fight malaria and prevent the next pandemic are the same. #MosquitoWeek  https://t.co/lC9eeVIN3J
1430594098696650753 2021-08-25 18:13:06 +0000 <BillGates> Mosquitoes are the deadliest animal to humans, but @WMPglobal scientists have discovered how to transform one kind of mosquito into a surprisingly powerful ally:  https://t.co/T6H9dVZYP0. #MosquitoWeek🦟  https://t.co/ENiniSLs9z
1430313520881541123 2021-08-24 23:38:11 +0000 <BillGates> I don’t think any of @ronnychieng’s innovations are ready to bring to market. Luckily, brilliant scientists and engineers around the world have developed hundreds of exciting solutions that will prevent illness and death:  https://t.co/x9lELyhV4c
1426589349240401927 2021-08-14 16:59:40 +0000 <BillGates> I applaud David Vélez and Mariel Reyes’s pledge to dedicate the majority of their wealth to creating opportunity for the most vulnerable Latin American children and young adults:  https://t.co/LGZ23efAVO
1426295503050870784 2021-08-13 21:32:01 +0000 <BillGates> Thank you to @DonorsChoose, and to all 40,255 of you who donated in support of students and teachers across the country.
1426254813876998145 2021-08-13 18:50:20 +0000 <BillGates> This collaboration’s impact is made possible through investments in the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which will unleash billions in private capital for clean energy projects throughout the U.S. if passed into law. Thank you @SecGranholm for your partnership.
1426254812153204737 2021-08-13 18:50:20 +0000 <BillGates> Avoiding a climate disaster will require a new, clean industrial revolution, and we don't have time to wait. Our work together will not only send us on a more viable path to net zero, but it will create long-term jobs in communities across the country.
1426254810479685634 2021-08-13 18:50:20 +0000 <BillGates> I'm incredibly excited about the new collaboration between @Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and @ENERGY to accelerate the adoption of next-generation clean technologies and build the net-zero economy:  https://t.co/85aqtW8HCr
1425828373054386192 2021-08-12 14:35:49 +0000 <BillGates> I’m partnering with @DonorsChoose to make sure that more teachers have access to everything they need to get ready for the new school year. I’ll give your donation an extra 50% boost today when you give to any classroom project or supply request.
1424867719153733632 2021-08-09 22:58:31 +0000 <BillGates> I’m optimistic about the work that @Breakthrough is doing to invest in companies, support innovators, advocate for better policies, and lower the cost of climate tech. Join us.  https://t.co/xlbtvEAqcn
1424867718319116289 2021-08-09 22:58:31 +0000 <BillGates> Reaching zero will take a complete transformation of how we make and do everything – from the technologies and products we create to our public policies to the way we use markets to accelerate change. We need a new industrial revolution powered by clean technology.
1424867717467697152 2021-08-09 22:58:31 +0000 <BillGates> Every climate action we take must be toward the goal of reaching zero. That means rapidly deploying the technologies we have today to reduce emissions and investing immediately in the solutions we still need to get the world to zero.
1424867716645625863 2021-08-09 22:58:31 +0000 <BillGates> Avoiding a disaster will require courage, ambition, and partnership among leaders in every sector around the globe. As the report makes clear, no region will be spared by climate change. It will take all of us to meet this challenge.
1424867715815071746 2021-08-09 22:58:30 +0000 <BillGates> Today’s United Nations climate report is an urgent call to action for the world: we must reach net-zero emissions by 2050 to avoid a climate disaster.  https://t.co/eSaC2HyD8q
1424409672308596736 2021-08-08 16:38:24 +0000 <BillGates> Alzheimer’s and related dementias have impacted far too many families around the world—including my own. New funding from @TheADDF will help @EDoNInitiative accelerate data collection and sharing to enable early detection and treatment.
1423710979913785344 2021-08-06 18:22:03 +0000 <BillGates> Today’s students have the power to create a better future for all people, and teachers are helping them build their framework for understanding the world. Thank you to Bryan Stevenson for joining the @OERProject Conference for Social Studies this week.  https://t.co/3tpHHnbICc
1423478170393579522 2021-08-06 02:56:57 +0000 <BillGates> I’m deeply saddened to hear of Tachi’s passing. I loved working with him and I learned a lot from him. His passion for saving lives and making the world a fairer place was inspiring, and he matched it with an incredible intellect. I will miss him.
1423370661485973504 2021-08-05 19:49:45 +0000 <BillGates> Vaclav Smil’s books are amazing. His latest will give you a framework to think about humanity:  https://t.co/sgWOBDRYR4  https://t.co/EsQNmjHvHg
1423338651061145600 2021-08-05 17:42:33 +0000 <BillGates> I enjoyed joining educators from around the world at the @OERProject Conference for the Social Studies to discuss how their teaching practices have changed over the last year and a half. I’m inspired by their resilience and dedication to their students:  https://t.co/e7A0IuUhz1  https://t.co/f5K54U0OZj
1422963100144209921 2021-08-04 16:50:15 +0000 <BillGates> The French drank an impressive amount of wine in 1926, but their consumption is now a third of what it was back then. Why? I love how this book forces you to think about the story behind a seemingly niche statistic.  https://t.co/BBlLdeyRJJ
1422620457384124421 2021-08-03 18:08:42 +0000 <BillGates> My favorite author’s new book might be his best one yet. Each chapter covers one of 71 facts about the world that help you understand how history ties together. I unabashedly recommend it to anyone who loves learning.  https://t.co/Sqg0r8K1GA
1422412317359153155 2021-08-03 04:21:38 +0000 <BillGates> Our foundation has been working to address this massive problem for 10 years—here’s one of the incredible Reinvent the Toilet designs that could help:  https://t.co/FWyi25kEhb  https://t.co/GnIeZhIDY8
1422220758827159556 2021-08-02 15:40:27 +0000 <BillGates> Ever heard a toilet be compared to an espresso machine? That’s how Dr. Shannon Yee describes the toilet he and his team have developed.  https://t.co/zvLAE6CJ5t
1422041111602765829 2021-08-02 03:46:35 +0000 <BillGates> How much of the world population still lacks access to a toilet that safely removes waste from the home?  Find the answer here:  https://t.co/IiIquCEvZ0
1421186855857360896 2021-07-30 19:12:05 +0000 <BillGates> This map from @OurWorldInData shows the progress we’ve made–but also highlights how much work we have left to do.  https://t.co/KmmhFnvctZ
1420823414613319682 2021-07-29 19:07:54 +0000 <BillGates> The COVID pandemic is a powerful reminder of the urgent work needed to contain and treat deadly pathogens. I’m optimistic about the progress being made on another crisis: safe sanitation:  https://t.co/88jFx2UjiW  https://t.co/h5HCSyQxO4
1420505627462307845 2021-07-28 22:05:07 +0000 <BillGates> You were a good sport, Jimmy. Pro tip...never choose glass “#2” in a poop-water challenge:  https://t.co/8shvjTNa4M
1420423383213248516 2021-07-28 16:38:19 +0000 <BillGates> The Gates Foundation is providing additional, flexible funding to the @AfricaCDC for its pandemic response efforts, but more assistance from the global community is urgently needed to fill the gaps.
1420164781244227587 2021-07-27 23:30:43 +0000 <BillGates> Over the years, I’ve shared a stage with a jar of human feces, smelled pit latrine odor, and drunk water made from poop (and convinced @jimmyfallon to drink it too). Was it worth it? You bet. Here’s why:  https://t.co/8SJbCuNezD
1419728206991544322 2021-07-26 18:35:56 +0000 <BillGates> I’ve been rewatching some of my favorite movies. Add your favorites to the list on @Likewise.  https://t.co/bEgD4aMmSU
1418724069063618562 2021-07-24 00:05:51 +0000 <BillGates> Getting an early start on my weekend reading: this article does a good job explaining immunity and what may happen with COVID-19 in the future.  https://t.co/AHatTlUdOr
1418266043512877057 2021-07-22 17:45:49 +0000 <BillGates> During the height of the U.S. polio epidemic, the iron lung was one of the greatest tools used to fight polio. Today, it’s the iron will of the thousands of workers and their supporters who are committed to finishing the job.  https://t.co/oAzGsIGSUN #endpolio
1417604296422694913 2021-07-20 21:56:16 +0000 <BillGates> Our foundation joined the polio fight almost 15 years ago. And in all that time, I cannot think of a more important moment than right now.  https://t.co/ZUyvSZyzau
1417328143103266816 2021-07-20 03:38:56 +0000 <BillGates> I look forward to working with you and @EU_Commission on all of these important goals. Europe is a critical partner in creating a net-zero future and ensuring a healthy and equitable world for all.
1417161086575337472 2021-07-19 16:35:07 +0000 <BillGates> Reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 means transforming our entire physical economy and accelerating innovation at an unprecedented pace. @Breakthrough Energy Catalyst will jumpstart this process.  https://t.co/MAKM2lAyy0
1415752955152666627 2021-07-15 19:19:42 +0000 <BillGates> This is the greatest opportunity for innovation in human history:  https://t.co/rBFo2LjpsH  https://t.co/bj6rY3FszB
1415360904351293440 2021-07-14 17:21:50 +0000 <BillGates> These students are doing inspiring work. Their ambition makes me optimistic about the future of health care (and the world).
1415025933090656257 2021-07-13 19:10:47 +0000 <BillGates> I’m excited about @Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and think it can help make clean-energy innovations more available and affordable for everyone.  https://t.co/59eVhOSrGC
1413558189128249344 2021-07-09 17:58:29 +0000 <BillGates> COVID-19 has highlighted how digital tools can save lives. I’m encouraged by @ExemplarsHealth research highlighting how technologies in Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Burkina Faso, Uganda, South Africa, and Vietnam can be scaled to detect and respond to pandemics.  https://t.co/x1W7IyhSnP
1412799723434504192 2021-07-07 15:44:37 +0000 <BillGates> This expanded commitment to the foundation will accelerate its mission to fight poverty, disease, and inequity around the world. I'm grateful to the foundation's leadership team, employees, and partners for their dedication to making the world healthier and more just.
1410710798997987328 2021-07-01 21:23:58 +0000 <BillGates> Stopping Alzheimer’s requires more eyes on the problem. ADDI @AlzData recently hosted their 1st Data Challenge. I was inspired to see more than 1,200+ people from 65+ countries/regions join the fight.  https://t.co/kTovX2SWch
1410637816720019457 2021-07-01 16:33:58 +0000 <BillGates> It’s really encouraging to see these results. Dengue fever infects hundreds of millions of people a year and causes debilitating disease. This incredible technique could also be effective at stopping the spread of other viruses like Zika and Chikungunya.  https://t.co/AdFpD1hW5c
1410266283476602886 2021-06-30 15:57:38 +0000 <BillGates> This important commitment builds on the @gatesfoundation's efforts to support partners working to create a more equal world.
1407733718198808578 2021-06-23 16:14:07 +0000 <BillGates> I am truly grateful for his wisdom and leadership, and most of all for his enduring friendship. Warren will continue to inspire our foundation as we work to fight poverty and help millions of people live healthier lives.  https://t.co/qYYl1APURx
1407733716617629699 2021-06-23 16:14:07 +0000 <BillGates> I will always have a deep sense of accountability to Warren, paying close attention to the data to track our progress and identify areas where we can do better. But the value of Warren’s gift goes beyond anything that can be measured.
1407391385670483972 2021-06-22 17:33:49 +0000 <BillGates> Should you pick your nose?  You can read an excerpt from Matt Richtel’s fascinating book about the immune system on my blog to find the answer:  https://t.co/cgfc1aUzPA  https://t.co/Uc7vqT2B1m
1405564300266139651 2021-06-17 16:33:37 +0000 <BillGates> The journalist @ElizKolbert has created a fascinating beat for herself covering humanity’s impact on nature and our attempts to control it. Her latest book is a good reminder that we need to watch out for the unforeseen effects of our actions.  https://t.co/8gt4I8oxXc
1405267364057206786 2021-06-16 20:53:42 +0000 <BillGates> The persistence of countless Rotarians gives me hope that we can achieve a polio-free world. As they close the #Rotary21 Convention, I'd like to thank @Rotary for the continued partnership to #endpolio.  https://t.co/sZ4dRiuiXk
1405201441669619712 2021-06-16 16:31:45 +0000 <BillGates> I'm almost always interested in books about American presidents, and I especially loved A Promised Land. It’s a fascinating look at what it’s like to steer a country through challenging times.  https://t.co/RgpXbkOnDw
1404841704507674629 2021-06-15 16:42:17 +0000 <BillGates> This book gave me a deeper, more nuanced appreciation for the system that is at the core of humanity’s fight against COVID-19 and everything our foundation’s Global Health program is trying to do.  https://t.co/uTUH19oKKc
1404514533788377089 2021-06-14 19:02:14 +0000 <BillGates> If you’re looking for a good book to read this summer, these are some of my favorites.  https://t.co/e19FKzFFL1
1404442043099717636 2021-06-14 14:14:11 +0000 <BillGates> The @G7’s commitment to share 870M COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next year is welcome news - but time is not on our side. Vaccines must be delivered now to help control the pandemic everywhere and not disrupt the progress we've made.  https://t.co/gWvonMax6n
1403082193216303108 2021-06-10 20:10:37 +0000 <BillGates> Polio tools and infrastructure are also critical to combatting other public health emergencies, like COVID-19. It is more important than ever that donors and countries commit to the new GPEI strategy to #endpolio and continue improving health for all.  https://t.co/jaN6hPRT23
1402741727224426497 2021-06-09 21:37:44 +0000 <BillGates> These young leaders make me optimistic that brighter days are ahead for America’s students and teachers.  https://t.co/aiue8lKiZ6
1401939942654169088 2021-06-07 16:31:43 +0000 <BillGates> Against the odds, @MohamedBailorB8 became a doctor and is helping his country recover from civil war, Ebola, and now COVID-19. This doctor’s life story is almost as remarkable as his work.  https://t.co/giKIhT4W8b
1400870268814258177 2021-06-04 17:41:13 +0000 <BillGates> This is an important step in the U.S. clean energy transition. I’m excited to see @TerraPower working with @PacifiCorp, @GovernorGordon, and @Energy to bring this project to life with the workforce of Wyoming.  https://t.co/AYeFV5aO5b
1400478260966744067 2021-06-03 15:43:31 +0000 <BillGates> Heroes like Dr. Mohamed Barrie are the reason we started our foundation more than 20 years ago and why Melinda and I remain committed to its work. Mohamed’s story is truly inspiring, and I can’t wait to see what he and his team will accomplish next.  https://t.co/ovDzfwSKwP
1400126638067576833 2021-06-02 16:26:18 +0000 <BillGates> This partnership between @Breakthrough Energy and the @EU_Commission will create jobs around the world, build sustainable global industries, and expand opportunity for billions:  https://t.co/mg9LNkabev. Thank you to @EIB as well for your support.  https://t.co/HoJdAd6t0z
1399863361383276545 2021-06-01 23:00:08 +0000 <BillGates> The pandemic has exacerbated existing racial health inequities in the United States. The Health Equity Tracker is a new tool bringing visibility to disparities in U.S. medicine.  https://t.co/vxAiSLifKT
1398800221132312579 2021-05-30 00:35:35 +0000 <BillGates> Avoiding a climate disaster is possible if governments act today. @IEA’s Net Zero by 2050 report provides a roadmap to achieve this critical goal.
1389316412259270657 2021-05-03 20:30:19 +0000 <BillGates>  https://t.co/padmHSgWGc
1385629820780908544 2021-04-23 16:21:07 +0000 <BillGates> I was honored to speak at today’s #LeadersClimateSummit about the three things we need to do to avoid a climate disaster.  https://t.co/0YJJyabeIn
1385344183523635200 2021-04-22 21:26:06 +0000 <BillGates> Ambitious short-term goals like this are critical to moving closer to a net-zero future. As we rapidly scale the solutions we have, we must also invest in innovation to reach our ultimate goals. Thank you @POTUS for your leadership.  https://t.co/SVeKp1KPHT
1385245518842896384 2021-04-22 14:54:02 +0000 <BillGates> It’s encouraging to see @POTUS Biden and @ClimateEnvoy Kerry re-establish America’s leading role on climate change. I look forward to joining leaders from around the world to talk about some of the most important challenges we need to overcome to avoid a climate disaster.
1385008987838455808 2021-04-21 23:14:09 +0000 <BillGates> Yesterday's verdict was a step in the right direction. But one court ruling alone will not bring to an end the injustice and inequity that Black people experience daily.  I hope we will continue to make real progress on this.
1381664682499481601 2021-04-12 17:45:05 +0000 <BillGates> “Time” is a poetic portrait of a family who love and support each other despite their difficult circumstances. I can’t recommend it highly enough.  https://t.co/pxkDEmL2SR
1381641702088187906 2021-04-12 16:13:46 +0000 <BillGates> If “Time” wins the Oscar this year, it will be the first documentary directed by a Black woman to do so. Garrett Bradley’s talent makes her worthy of that milestone. This is one of the most intimate movies I have ever seen. #itsTIME  https://t.co/37x1gfWZgZ
1381389752591548418 2021-04-11 23:32:36 +0000 <BillGates> Communities of color have been hit hard by COVID-19. One of the reasons why parts of the medical system often fail Black and brown people is because it’s not designed with them in mind. Dr. Stephaun Wallace wants to change that.  https://t.co/VIaM9385bv
1380599008238792705 2021-04-09 19:10:28 +0000 <BillGates> To get to net-zero emissions globally by 2050, leaders from around the world must work together. It’s encouraging to see governments, business leaders, and financial institutions committing to a successful COP26 in Glasgow later this year.  https://t.co/9bLQJvfZIR
1380231432006631425 2021-04-08 18:49:51 +0000 <BillGates> Dr. Stephaun Wallace (@imstephaunelite) has spent the last year helping make COVID-19 vaccines work for everybody.

1379459602903785474 2021-04-06 15:42:53 +0000 <BillGates> The amount of cement China has consumed is a staggering statistic and reminder of how much emissions have grown in low- and middle-income countries. (Minecraft concrete doesn’t count, though server farms are responsible for a lot of emissions.)  https://t.co/bFrIIUv97i
1379092816089862145 2021-04-05 15:25:24 +0000 <BillGates> Cement is responsible for 6% of carbon emissions globally. To get to net-zero by 2050, we need innovations to decarbonize the material. I discuss a few approaches to make low-emission cement in my climate book:  https://t.co/Ok1p3xQir4

1372645545471143938 2021-03-18 20:26:15 +0000 <BillGates> It’s deeply unfair that the people who contribute the least to climate change will suffer the worst from its effects:  https://t.co/XciR3lIVzs  https://t.co/Y2do5GhsGx
1372221245303844865 2021-03-17 16:20:14 +0000 <BillGates> I named my book “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,” not “How to Stop Climate Change,” because our climate is already changing—and no one will be hurt more by climate change than the world’s poorest people. Here's how we can help them adapt.  https://t.co/9mLJUpYErv
1370159252401053697 2021-03-11 23:46:36 +0000 <BillGates> Congratulations @AndrewSteerWRI on this important role. I’m excited to see what you and the Earth Fund will achieve. Avoiding a climate disaster is going to take all of us, and I’m grateful for @JeffBezos’s leadership and partnership.

1367519920393654274 2021-03-04 16:58:50 +0000 <BillGates> Moving to a green economy is the biggest challenge the world has ever faced. I’m optimistic we can do it, but need to make sure it benefits everyone—including those workers and communities who depend on the fossil fuels that we need to get rid of.  https://t.co/UsjyfdOuQi
1367274659402584065 2021-03-04 00:44:16 +0000 <BillGates> We can’t avoid a climate disaster without corporate leaders making courageous decisions now. I hope to work with @VWGroup on building the markets for the clean technologies the world needs. Thank you for the kind words, Herbert.
1366115858955726848 2021-02-28 19:59:36 +0000 <BillGates> @EU_H2020 @EIB @Breakthrough @BloomBiorenewa1 To get to net zero, we need innovation to replace fossil fuels in everyday products like plastics. @BloomBiorenewa1 is one of the many companies leading on this important work.
1365426141457125377 2021-02-26 22:18:55 +0000 <BillGates> We're fortunate to have an Energy Secretary who's focused on creating high-quality jobs to build a clean energy economy. I look forward to working with @SecGranholm on clean tech innovation and deployment.  https://t.co/xFmM5zEIGp

1362533658557440001 2021-02-18 22:45:13 +0000 <BillGates> Thanks for inviting me on the podcast, @karaswisher.
1362499076189687812 2021-02-18 20:27:48 +0000 <BillGates> Thank you, @AlokSharma_RDG. We have a lot of work ahead of us to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and avoid a climate disaster. Your leadership of #COP26 is critical. Thanks also to @howtoacademy, @penguinlive and @Waterstones for hosting the London stop of my virtual book tour!
1362205392743198724 2021-02-18 01:00:48 +0000 <BillGates> It was great to talk with @alroker about my new book and the solutions we need to fight climate change.

1361353802796855297 2021-02-15 16:36:53 +0000 <BillGates> The world’s power to invent makes me hopeful about climate change. Breakthrough Energy supports the innovations that will lead the world to net-zero emissions.  https://t.co/yBb8HMKAmJ
1361152602419814404 2021-02-15 03:17:24 +0000 <BillGates> To avoid a climate disaster, we need to eliminate emissions from the ways we create electricity, grow food, make things, move around, and heat and cool our buildings. It won’t be easy, but I believe we can do it. This book is about what it will take.  https://t.co/xyzs0x6CwB
1361124071379898368 2021-02-15 01:24:01 +0000 <BillGates> I enjoyed spending time with @andersoncooper recently in Seattle. We talked about why I’m optimistic that the world can get to zero greenhouse gas emissions and avoid a climate disaster:  https://t.co/exodP9bavN  https://t.co/2t0VncI0pA

1356374923078369281 2021-02-01 22:52:36 +0000 <BillGates> When it comes to preventing pandemics, scientific tools alone aren’t enough. We also need new capabilities, including a global alert system and infectious disease first responders (or what I like to call a pandemic fire squad):  https://t.co/53Rf5uvjub  https://t.co/rTmM7STl6U
1354824962645712899 2021-01-28 16:13:37 +0000 <BillGates> COVID-19 has cost lives, sickened millions, and thrust the global economy into a devastating recession. But hope is on the horizon:  https://t.co/clsscPwQUD  https://t.co/sNl4kT9bE3
1354452894146154500 2021-01-27 15:35:09 +0000 <BillGates> This has been a year unlike any other in our lifetimes. In our new Annual Letter, Melinda and I talk about how we can turn the hard-won lessons of the pandemic into a healthier, more equal future for all.  https://t.co/Zt42aWl86x
1352732374568636416 2021-01-22 21:38:25 +0000 <BillGates> Here are four other ways that America can advance its leadership on climate change this year and put the world on a path to zero emissions by 2050:  https://t.co/vxEjYjqAaD
1352662770416664577 2021-01-22 17:01:50 +0000 <BillGates> One of the benefits of being 65 is that I’m eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. I got my first dose this week, and I feel great. Thank you to all of the scientists, trial participants, regulators, and frontline healthcare workers who got us to this point.  https://t.co/67SIfrG1Yd
1352333862144077824 2021-01-21 19:14:52 +0000 <BillGates> It’s great to see President Biden elevate science leadership to a cabinet-level position. Congratulations @eric_lander.
1352021075358482432 2021-01-20 22:31:58 +0000 <BillGates> And while COVID-19 will rightfully continue to dominate the agenda, the United States also has the opportunity to lead the world in avoiding a climate disaster. The President is taking a great first step by rejoining the Paris Climate Accord.
1352021074544795653 2021-01-20 22:31:58 +0000 <BillGates> The President’s commitment to reengage with the world gives me hope that the recovery will reach everyone, including communities of color in the U.S. and people in poor countries around the world.
1352021073756254209 2021-01-20 22:31:57 +0000 <BillGates> With Americans across the country working together, more people get a COVID-19 vaccine every day, bringing us closer to a time when life will look much more like normal. Until then, we can slow the spread of the virus and save lives by continuing to distance and wear masks.
1352021072980295680 2021-01-20 22:31:57 +0000 <BillGates> I look forward to working with President @JoeBiden and Vice President @KamalaHarris to tackle some of our toughest challenges like COVID-19 and climate change. This has been a troubling time in America, but I see promise in the months and years ahead.
1351256621993738240 2021-01-18 19:54:18 +0000 <BillGates> #MLKDay has long been a national day of service. As we celebrate the first without Congressman John Lewis, I'm thinking about his powerful call to remain hopeful about the future as we work to make our country—and our world—a better place.  https://t.co/RpmKvrzjPo
1346184604827279360 2021-01-04 19:59:55 +0000 <BillGates> It’s great to see India’s leadership in scientific innovation and vaccine manufacturing capability as the world works to end the COVID-19 pandemic @PMOIndia  https://t.co/Ds4f3tmrm3

1341457994396024832 2020-12-22 18:58:03 +0000 <BillGates> 2021 will be better than 2020. Here’s why:  https://t.co/mYbpl5wwF1
1340371845992775680 2020-12-19 19:02:05 +0000 <BillGates> Standing up for science has never been more important. Congratulations to Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Salim Abdool Karim on receiving this honor.
1340126858013147136 2020-12-19 02:48:35 +0000 <BillGates> I've known and learned from @RonConway for more than 40 years. I'm glad to see @svangel team up with @bchesky to mentor and support companies working to create more economic empowerment opportunities for people across the world.
1339979894332088321 2020-12-18 17:04:37 +0000 <BillGates> This book has nothing to do with viruses or pandemics. But it is surprisingly relevant for these times. @exlarson provides a brilliant and gripping account of another era of widespread anxiety: the years 1940 and 1941.  https://t.co/cm6IunxOZL
1339743564419371010 2020-12-18 01:25:31 +0000 <BillGates> Monoclonal antibodies are one of the most promising treatments we have for COVID-19, thanks in large part to R&amp;D by Canadian scientists. Because of their generosity, people all around the world will have access to this potentially lifesaving treatment.  https://t.co/2flhbV7e4n
1338947631091892224 2020-12-15 20:42:46 +0000 <BillGates> Like many people, I’ve tried to deepen my understanding of systemic racism in recent months. If you’re interested in learning more about the lives caught up in our country's justice system, I highly recommend @thenewjimcrow by Michelle Alexander.  https://t.co/jicgoLZl1j
1338629121354526721 2020-12-14 23:37:07 +0000 <BillGates> The season finale of our podcast features two incredible people who are using their positions as artists to change the world for the better.  https://t.co/MWji3SfCtx
1337546673610887169 2020-12-11 23:55:52 +0000 <BillGates> Thanks for the great conversation, Carlos.
1336751572043194370 2020-12-09 19:16:25 +0000 <BillGates> Bill Foege and Viktor Zdanov are phenomenal examples of what it means to harness science for global health. A well-deserved honor.
1336366810443042818 2020-12-08 17:47:30 +0000 <BillGates> Here are five books that I’d recommend as we wrap up 2020. I hope you find something that helps you—or the book lover in your life—finish the year on a good note.  https://t.co/9N0hL2xvTQ
1336027841289277441 2020-12-07 19:20:34 +0000 <BillGates> Are we actually making progress on climate change? Can we really prevent a climate disaster? In this week’s podcast, Rashida and I take on perhaps our biggest question yet with Pulitzer Prize-winning author @ElizKolbert.  https://t.co/ugS31mpJin
1335246628609871873 2020-12-05 15:36:18 +0000 <BillGates> This new quiz from @Gapminder is a clever way to fight misconceptions and “upgrade your worldview” about the incredible progress the world has made toward the Sustainable Development Goals to end poverty, fight inequality, and stop climate change:  https://t.co/Qo0oaxv1tb
1334908118162046976 2020-12-04 17:11:11 +0000 <BillGates> Rashida Jones and I talked to Yuval Noah Harari about COVID conspiracy theories, the role social media plays in spreading misinformation, and the one lie I choose to believe even though I know it’s not always true:  https://t.co/7pzUFsMf5D  https://t.co/YEjZaXLTbJ
1334550143031361536 2020-12-03 17:28:43 +0000 <BillGates> I believe we can avoid a climate disaster—if we deploy the clean-energy tools we have now wisely, and if we make big breakthroughs that touch every aspect of our physical economy. Creating the National Institutes of Energy Innovation would put us on the right path.
1334550142104477703 2020-12-03 17:28:43 +0000 <BillGates> To reduce duplication, focus the government’s efforts, and get the most innovation out of every dollar of funding, we should create a new organization: the National Institutes of Energy Innovation.
1334550141160673280 2020-12-03 17:28:43 +0000 <BillGates> We need to revolutionize the world’s physical economy—and that will take, among other things, a dramatic infusion of ingenuity, funding, and focus from the federal government.
1334550140179267585 2020-12-03 17:28:42 +0000 <BillGates> This the most important thing the U.S. can do to lead the world in innovations that will solve climate change.  https://t.co/LG9uOnM92r

1311723478886694913 2020-10-01 17:43:42 +0000 <BillGates> I’m excited to see this kind of innovation. Detecting and predicting outbreaks earlier is critical to preventing epidemics.  https://t.co/ZadPiUS73z
1311372943604068352 2020-09-30 18:30:48 +0000 <BillGates> The only way to eliminate the threat of COVID-19 somewhere is to eliminate it everywhere. By making sure poor countries are equipped to stop this disease, wealthy countries will help themselves and bring this crisis to an end sooner.  https://t.co/CzFHuwdPcS
1311077469831622656 2020-09-29 22:56:42 +0000 <BillGates> Understanding this concept can help us measure our progress toward eliminating carbon emissions and serve as a guide to action.  https://t.co/xA0rjh8xBk
1310642001432383489 2020-09-28 18:06:18 +0000 <BillGates> Developing and manufacturing vaccines won’t end the pandemic quickly unless we also deliver them equitably. Here is why it’s critical that vaccines are distributed in proportion to the global population:  https://t.co/XFTYVZ2C2N  https://t.co/ZL0ulACxdM
1309902604755849216 2020-09-26 17:08:12 +0000 <BillGates> Great to see the UK commit vital funding to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available for the world’s poorest people. PM @BorisJohnson's plan will improve the way we prepare for future crises like this.  https://t.co/SMzVlVpEyQ
1309228127726395392 2020-09-24 20:28:04 +0000 <BillGates> After 20 years of stunning advances toward global goals to improve health and reduce poverty, the COVID-19 pandemic stopped progress in its tracks. In our foundation’s Goalkeepers report, we survey the damage and discuss how to start reversing it.  https://t.co/5e41bGrlUp
1309147157040111616 2020-09-24 15:06:19 +0000 <BillGates> To prevent the worst effects of climate change, we need innovation across all sectors—especially in the hardest to decarbonize sectors—to get us on a viable path to net-zero emissions.
1308875248314601473 2020-09-23 21:05:51 +0000 <BillGates> Dr. John Nkengasong is a true Goalkeeper. His leadership will help ensure Africa has the tools it needs to fight COVID-19:  https://t.co/E0gxmT6ahF  https://t.co/tOs2Ef0Euf

1304071051178061826 2020-09-10 14:55:41 +0000 <BillGates> These heroes represent the best of who we can be. Their efforts to solve the world’s challenges demonstrate our values as a society and they serve as powerful examples of how to make a positive difference in the world.  https://t.co/u9n0WvN0EP
1301604266738507777 2020-09-03 19:33:34 +0000 <BillGates> Clinical trials are critical to helping researchers better understand Alzheimer's. Improving how we identify and enroll participants in those trials will accelerate progress on diagnosing and treating the disease.  https://t.co/PLUhTVOylO
1300901312393932801 2020-09-01 21:00:17 +0000 <BillGates> I tackle every big new problem by asking two questions: Who has dealt with this problem well? And what can we learn from them? @ExemplarsHealth will help to fill the gap in global health knowledge sharing and to accelerate progress in saving lives.  https://t.co/5OhO10BVVP
1300110510738698241 2020-08-30 16:37:55 +0000 <BillGates> Of all the things I’ve learned from Warren Buffett (and there have been a lot), the most important might be what friendship is all about. Here’s why he’s a person that I admire as well as like:  https://t.co/XbZTIfO90b

1298639188904931330 2020-08-26 15:11:24 +0000 <BillGates> If we’re going to address climate change, we need to find new ways to do things that don’t release greenhouse gases—including how we move around.  https://t.co/ElpoZs2ZHG
1298321590153748480 2020-08-25 18:09:23 +0000 <BillGates> Today we move one step closer toward a world without polio. This is an incredible milestone that’s worth celebrating.

1297219798925860864 2020-08-22 17:11:15 +0000 <BillGates> Mosquito City is home to the world’s largest captive colony of mosquitoes. @IfakaraHealth Institute is doing fascinating research there about mosquito behaviors and finding ways to outsmart them.  https://t.co/p3r11gMqdn
1296474314221522944 2020-08-20 15:48:58 +0000 <BillGates> Deaths from malaria have been cut by more than half since the year 2000. Increased bed net use is one of the main reasons why  https://t.co/qxMqqCUs11 #WorldMosquitoDay
1296101267152859136 2020-08-19 15:06:37 +0000 <BillGates> Ridding the world of preventable, treatable diseases like malaria will save millions of lives and lead to healthier, more prosperous communities. And that will make them better prepared to confront any new health challenges like COVID-19 in the future.  https://t.co/6AbgoLSVai  https://t.co/D6xm7XeuBH
1295746102654713856 2020-08-18 15:35:19 +0000 <BillGates> The progress the world has made against malaria is one of the greatest success stories ever. The COVID-19 pandemic only reinforces why eradicating malaria is so essential.  https://t.co/aEtxSWNegs

1293946125540446209 2020-08-13 16:22:51 +0000 <BillGates> Because of long-standing barriers that are made worse by COVID-19, hundreds of thousands of students with promise may never start college. This would be disastrous for these young people and for the country. Here’s what we’re doing to help:  https://t.co/2NqFWLr30o
1293648528850395141 2020-08-12 20:40:18 +0000 <BillGates> Teaching special education takes an amazing person to figure out exactly what works for each child. Talking with Washington State Teacher of the Year Amy Campbell gave me an even greater appreciation for these educators:  https://t.co/YIxI1eoMkG  https://t.co/kOY0tciVAp
1293200772432195586 2020-08-11 15:01:05 +0000 <BillGates> Our foundation is partnering with @DonorsChoose to support teachers as they get ready to go back to school—in whatever form that takes—and will boost your donations to the classroom project of your choice today.  https://t.co/nh3CnQI9vm

1291796706552684548 2020-08-07 18:01:49 +0000 <BillGates> The world did not do enough to prepare for a pandemic. We can avoid making the same mistake with climate change by:  1. Letting science and innovation lead the way 2. Making sure solutions work for poor countries too 3. Getting started now   https://t.co/p9m1j5QuJ7
1290737051910803458 2020-08-04 19:51:08 +0000 <BillGates> If we learn the lessons of COVID-19, we can approach climate change more informed about the consequences of inaction, and more prepared to save lives and prevent the worst possible outcome.  https://t.co/a1Ltv44UBY
1289266330407964673 2020-07-31 18:27:01 +0000 <BillGates> In his final words, John Lewis challenges all of us to continue to stand up for what we truly believe. “Together, you can redeem the soul of our nation.”    https://t.co/5qj0T86Fr1
1288994039367262208 2020-07-31 00:25:01 +0000 <BillGates> The impacts of COVID-19 are driving worrying increases in malnutrition and health outcomes. However, there are clear actions that can be taken in both the near- and long-term.
1288869949927170048 2020-07-30 16:11:56 +0000 <BillGates> In these challenging times, we can’t lose sight of the importance of combatting climate change. I’m excited to hear about how companies like @Microsoft are finding a way to play a role.
1288615136777760771 2020-07-29 23:19:24 +0000 <BillGates> Science and innovation will help us beat COVID-19. Dr. Fauci explains why.  https://t.co/ZL597r4pNZ
1288606082248486913 2020-07-29 22:43:25 +0000 <BillGates> It’s important that we continue to follow scientific data as we look for new tools to aid in the fight against coronavirus.   https://t.co/AKZ3MI5H8i
1288575466199117831 2020-07-29 20:41:46 +0000 <BillGates> “I truly believe that if there is faith and hope and determination, we can continue to lay progress and create an American community at peace with ourselves.”    John Lewis will continue to inspire generations of Americans.   https://t.co/rfJrwTLZ0d

1288188016444366848 2020-07-28 19:02:11 +0000 <BillGates> Investments in digital technology that strengthen Africa’s food and health security will be critical to help the continent recover and thrive after the pandemic.  https://t.co/wuDasFFYY0
1286729555013640192 2020-07-24 18:26:46 +0000 <BillGates> "Our best strategy in the age-old fight against the germs is our collaborative, data-based effort to study the world around us and within us. Our best strategy is science." @MaxCRoser explains how vaccines have dramatically improved humanity’s ability to fight infectious disease.
1284344478254247937 2020-07-18 04:29:20 +0000 <BillGates> This is a great loss for America, and for everyone who believes in making the world a more just place. John Lewis not only saw that our country could be better--he never stopped working to make it that way. We need leaders like him more than ever.
1278763974914236416 2020-07-02 18:54:24 +0000 <BillGates> Globally, a lack of medical oxygen–needed to treat pneumonia, malaria, and other diseases–leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. @BernardOlayo founded @Hewa_Tele to address this often-overlooked challenge.  https://t.co/TSea0oyDjP
1278763932547612673 2020-07-02 18:54:14 +0000 <BillGates> This hero is playing a critical role in Kenya’s preparations to tackle COVID-19 by scaling up medical oxygen supplies that will be needed to keep the most critically ill patients alive.  https://t.co/U2YcRgzSDA
1270563828435046400 2020-06-10 03:49:57 +0000 <BillGates> I am committed to listening and learning more about systemic racism and what I can do with my actions and words to help create a more equal and just future. Black lives matter.

1270563826115600385 2020-06-10 03:49:56 +0000 <BillGates> The horrifying killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and far too many other Black people—and the protests they sparked—are shining a light on the brutal injustices that Black people experience every day…
1265770438543605760 2020-05-27 22:22:44 +0000 <BillGates> I continue to be inspired by all of the volunteers (including many retired health care workers and teachers) on the front lines of the fight against coronavirus each day.
1265315854683525122 2020-05-26 16:16:22 +0000 <BillGates> Here are five books to read this summer if you want to learn more about pandemics or are looking for a distraction:  https://t.co/B5AX6d7uah  https://t.co/jSvUXQ3Buo

1263152510845571072 2020-05-20 17:00:01 +0000 <BillGates> The 1918 influenza outbreak is the closest comparison to what we’re living through right now. John Barry does a great job explaining the realities and lessons of that devastating pandemic.  https://t.co/dG1RKAK0in
1262433965434122243 2020-05-18 17:24:46 +0000 <BillGates> Most of my conversations these days are about COVID-19 and how we can stem the tide, but I’m also often asked about what I am reading and watching.

1261041440404062208 2020-05-14 21:11:23 +0000 <BillGates> @narendramodi @gatesfoundation Thank you for the conversation and partnership, @narendramodi. Combating the pandemic requires global collaboration. India’s role is key as the world works to minimize social and economic impact, and pave the way to vaccine, testing, and treatment access for all. @PMOIndia
1260374775144251393 2020-05-13 01:02:17 +0000 <BillGates> I’m hopeful that this program will improve our understanding of the coronavirus outbreak in Seattle and provide valuable information about the virus for other communities around the world.  https://t.co/wnFarp28ys
1257729137697054726 2020-05-05 17:49:28 +0000 <BillGates> Class of 2020, these are not easy times. But we will get through them. And with your leadership, the world will be stronger than before.  https://t.co/rypFlsAles
1256292084954230784 2020-05-01 18:39:08 +0000 <BillGates> There are over 100 different coronavirus vaccine candidates in the works. These candidates take a variety of approaches to protecting the body against COVID-19:  https://t.co/sFTGWFLgIq  https://t.co/9iPgeIzG1E
1255902245922709506 2020-04-30 16:50:03 +0000 <BillGates> Humankind has never had a more urgent task than creating broad immunity for coronavirus. It’s going to require a global cooperative effort like the world has never seen. But I know we’ll get it done. There’s simply no alternative.  https://t.co/lDRkgqJ39k
1253362888678371329 2020-04-23 16:39:33 +0000 <BillGates> We don't yet have all the tools we need to stop the novel coronavirus and safely re-open the economy. But they are on the horizon.  https://t.co/1q7YHRXokz
1252978035692724231 2020-04-22 15:10:17 +0000 <BillGates> This is a great introduction to computer science concepts for students at all levels. I’m looking forward to joining today’s Code Break.
1250292126643941376 2020-04-15 05:17:26 +0000 <BillGates> Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds. Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them. The world needs @WHO now more than ever.
1249497817900433408 2020-04-13 00:41:08 +0000 <BillGates> .@NickKristof does an amazing job capturing the heroism of the health care workers on the front lines of the coronavirus fight.  https://t.co/x1TgE2oNXE
1247629990675374081 2020-04-07 20:59:04 +0000 <BillGates> On #WorldHealthDay — and every day — I want to thank all of the health heroes for their sacrifices and for keeping us safe.  https://t.co/0x9QFSrlQb
1246923341769986051 2020-04-05 22:11:06 +0000 <BillGates> I always enjoy chatting with @Trevornoah, even though we had to sit a little bit further apart than usual this time.
1246174663778025473 2020-04-03 20:36:07 +0000 <BillGates> It’s encouraging to see the first projects begin from our effort to accelerate safe and effective drugs for #COVID19.
1246121692914540545 2020-04-03 17:05:38 +0000 <BillGates> I’m excited to join the @khanacademy Daily Homeroom today to talk about the incredible ways parents, teachers, and students are coming together to keep learning while schools are closed.
1245738296027697153 2020-04-02 15:42:09 +0000 <BillGates> If we make the right decisions now—informed by science, data and the experience of medical professionals—we can save lives and get the country back to work. You can read more about my thoughts on #COVID19 on my blog.  https://t.co/KN58B8Hs11
1245738295008489473 2020-04-02 15:42:08 +0000 <BillGates> In the meantime, frontline health care workers are making heroic efforts to test and treat patients across the United States and the world. Here in my hometown, Public Health Seattle &amp; King County (@KCPubHealth) is doing incredible work that we should all be very proud of.
1245738294035410946 2020-04-02 15:42:08 +0000 <BillGates> All the work that rich countries are doing now to develop vaccines will save lives in developing countries too. Without a vaccine, those countries are at even greater risk than wealthy ones, because it’s even harder for them to do physical distancing and shutdowns.
1245738293058097155 2020-04-02 15:42:08 +0000 <BillGates> If everything goes well, there might be an effective vaccine in less than 18 months—the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. That will depend on decisions we make today, including the federal government investing in building up manufacturing capacity.
1245738292089221120 2020-04-02 15:42:08 +0000 <BillGates> Work is going full speed on potential treatments, and vaccines. But people should know that it will take time to prove they are safe and effective and to start making them.
1245738291011280897 2020-04-02 15:42:07 +0000 <BillGates> There’s been some progress on more efficient testing methods, such as the self-swab developed by the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network. I hope this and other innovations in testing are scaled up across the country soon.  https://t.co/qdrr7Qz16r
1245738290088538112 2020-04-02 15:42:07 +0000 <BillGates> The federal government needs to step up on testing: far more tests should be made available, and we should aggregate the results so we can quickly identify potential volunteers for clinical trials and know with confidence when it’s time to return to normal.
1245738288972853248 2020-04-02 15:42:07 +0000 <BillGates> Extreme physical distancing measures will make a big difference in the U.S., but we need a consistent nationwide approach. Until the case numbers start to go down across America—which could take 10 weeks or more—no one can continue business as usual or relax the shutdown.
1245738287899148288 2020-04-02 15:42:07 +0000 <BillGates> There’s no question the United States missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel #coronavirus. But the window for making important decisions hasn’t closed. The choices we and our leaders make now will have an enormous impact.  https://t.co/mAa2XWwBIB
1245059667840995328 2020-03-31 18:45:31 +0000 <BillGates> I’m inspired by the generosity of everyone who has contributed to this effort to help keep kids learning at home. Thank you to @DonorsChoose and especially the educators who are doing amazing things for their students every day.
1244719799663501313 2020-03-30 20:15:00 +0000 <BillGates> One of the questions I am most often asked about the #COVID19 pandemic is how, and when, it will end. This article by @edyong209 does a really good job of outlining the steps we need to take.  https://t.co/hA2JChowQS
1244293238606962696 2020-03-29 16:00:00 +0000 <BillGates> This impressive new tool from @IHME_UW will help hospitals, policymakers, and the general public better understand and prepare for the #COVID19 response in the U.S.  https://t.co/tTd5tEtTRc
1244015172089339910 2020-03-28 21:35:04 +0000 <BillGates> This is encouraging news, but we still have a lot of work to do. Extreme physical distancing and testing are the best tools we have right now to slow the spread of novel coronavirus.  https://t.co/7IHhb8CaFD
1243932782843305984 2020-03-28 16:07:41 +0000 <BillGates> There are few people I’ve learned more from over the years–especially about viruses–than Peter Piot. This Q&amp;A with him is an excellent, easy-to-understand primer on #COVID19:  https://t.co/dBntxKnybd  https://t.co/R6M4fItYHU
1243568815641853953 2020-03-27 16:01:24 +0000 <BillGates> I’ve been impressed by governors across the country including @JayInslee, @NYGovCuomo, @GavinNewsom, @GovMikeDeWine, @GovLarryHogan, and the many others who are guiding their communities through this challenge and providing a model for us all to follow.
1243418437163995137 2020-03-27 06:03:51 +0000 <BillGates> Thanks to Norway and Prime Minister @erna_solberg for their ongoing leadership in global health and important investments in vaccines.
1243246023943663616 2020-03-26 18:38:45 +0000 <BillGates> The international response will require funding for @CEPIVaccines’s development of a COVID-19 vaccine and for @Gavi. Thanks to @BorisJohnson and the UK for this vital commitment.
1243199284209737729 2020-03-26 15:33:01 +0000 <BillGates> Lots of people in Seattle have asked how they can help those impacted by #COVID19 locally. @allinseattle has done a great job identifying organizations who are already on the ground and deploying resources quickly to help our friends and neighbors:  https://t.co/SfjeWBBmNu  https://t.co/hNGivjDcRk
1243189897655009280 2020-03-26 14:55:43 +0000 <BillGates> Thanks for your leadership, @rogerfederer. This is an inspiring contribution and will make a big difference for families.
1242848916971892736 2020-03-25 16:20:47 +0000 <BillGates> Teachers are doing incredible work to keep kids learning while at home. To help get supplies to those most in need, Melinda and I will double your impact, up to $1 million total, when you give to @DonorsChoose coronavirus relief effort today and tomorrow.  https://t.co/RkaQz1AOGR
1242482338145030146 2020-03-24 16:04:08 +0000 <BillGates> I’m connecting live with @TEDchris and @WhitPennRod to talk about what our healthcare systems need to tackle the #COVID19 pandemic and prepare for future epidemics.
1240767543213768704 2020-03-19 22:30:09 +0000 <BillGates> Thanks @reddit for joining me yesterday to discuss the #COVID19 pandemic and what we can do to prevent the next one. Here's a recap of the conversation:  https://t.co/RUtVlxIst0  https://t.co/QUFZMteGlO
1240319616980643840 2020-03-18 16:50:15 +0000 <BillGates> I’m answering your questions about the #COVID19 coronavirus on @reddit in 10 minutes:  https://t.co/JXEYRCpCza  https://t.co/ESyUqomdSD
1240305103313072128 2020-03-18 15:52:35 +0000 <BillGates> I know many parents are looking for resources and ideas to help their kids continue learning while home. @khanacademy has created daily schedules with interactive content--exercises, videos and articles--for students in every grade.  https://t.co/uxYRoULXF1
1237235176452706304 2020-03-10 04:33:47 +0000 <BillGates> We don’t yet have all the tools we need to fight COVID-19. This is an important step toward having treatments, while we also explore vaccines and diagnostics. Thanks to @wellcometrust and @mastercard for launching this effort with us.
1233449330348085249 2020-02-28 17:50:11 +0000 <BillGates> COVID-19 could be a once-in-a-century pandemic, but the good news is that there are steps we can take now to slow its impact and help us respond more effectively when the next epidemic arrives. #COVID19  https://t.co/7alFsXL27h
1232721832450486273 2020-02-26 17:39:22 +0000 <BillGates> 1 in 4 children under five in South Africa are stunted. The @GrowGreatZA Campaign is empowering new and pregnant moms to keep their children healthy. Here’s why I’m optimistic that they can make an impact:  https://t.co/a97kqWCycu  https://t.co/PLGOXZILW5
1232382252778172416 2020-02-25 19:10:00 +0000 <BillGates> Melinda and I have met many stunted children in our travels. It’s heartbreaking and utterly preventable. Dr. @kopanomabaso is leading an incredible effort to eliminate child stunting from South Africa over the next decade.  https://t.co/POaKqkLowv
1230881872915369988 2020-02-21 15:48:01 +0000 <BillGates> Climate change is one of the toughest challenges the world has ever taken on. But I believe we can avoid a climate catastrophe if we take steps now to reduce emissions and find ways to adapt to a warmer world. Here’s how we’re approaching the challenge:  https://t.co/MtZAZHrHyJ  https://t.co/MEmsGFsbUN
1230548925947486208 2020-02-20 17:45:01 +0000 <BillGates> When Warren Buffett donated the bulk of his fortune to our foundation and joined us as a partner in its work, he urged us to “swing for the fences.” All these years later, that advice still guides how we think about our philanthropy:  https://t.co/lmpKbixhOZ  https://t.co/UMixa49gdQ
1230217510185652224 2020-02-19 19:48:05 +0000 <BillGates> Diseases that cause dementia are only diagnosed after symptoms start. To effectively treat these diseases, we need to be able to diagnose them decades earlier when they first take hold in the brain.
1229780754680418305 2020-02-18 14:52:34 +0000 <BillGates> We’re hopeful that our foundation’s work with Networks for School Improvement will help increase the number of Black, Latinx, and low-income students who graduate from high school and pursue postsecondary opportunities. Here’s why that’s so important:  https://t.co/Kc5iCU6qhE  https://t.co/anMDUnuVPh
1229570023242354688 2020-02-18 00:55:12 +0000 <BillGates> It was a magical night. I'm very happy to support your foundation's incredible work.
1229252775327854595 2020-02-17 03:54:34 +0000 <BillGates> Vaccines are a miracle. But how exactly do they work? I explain the science behind vaccines and why our foundation’s investment in them is one of the best we’ve ever made:  https://t.co/fwpQOp93kb  https://t.co/ODohrGfsKg
1228462433230098433 2020-02-14 23:34:02 +0000 <BillGates> Science is giving us the opportunity to improve lives around the world faster than ever before. Today I was honored to give a speech on this subject at the @aaas annual meeting. #AAASmtg  https://t.co/03yWD4svD6
1228067489340280833 2020-02-13 21:24:40 +0000 <BillGates> This is an incredible story about the power of vaccines. 13 million people are alive today thanks to @Gavi. Here’s how:  https://t.co/3Zyw9mIqYu  https://t.co/sSOjYB7ZOf
1227725115766394880 2020-02-12 22:44:12 +0000 <BillGates> The only way we'll achieve net-zero carbon emissions is if we innovate, deploy, and invest across all sectors. It's encouraging to see companies working to get our planet one step closer. Congratulations to all the winners of the #BreakthroughCanada initiative.
1227302648820289538 2020-02-11 18:45:28 +0000 <BillGates> When we first started our foundation, Melinda and I were optimistic about the power of innovation to drive progress. Twenty years later, we’re just as optimistic, and we’re still swinging for the fences:  https://t.co/xF4YpnawpN  https://t.co/sDxmLHASXr
1226776586298388480 2020-02-10 07:55:05 +0000 <BillGates> In our new annual letter, @melindagates and I write about why we think the risks we’ve taken in the first two decades of our foundation have set us up for future progress.  https://t.co/c1ewuGXyhl
1224493906328317952 2020-02-04 00:44:31 +0000 <BillGates> @rogerfederer @RafaelNadal @Trevornoah Roger’s foundation partners with local NGOs in six countries in southern Africa to improve early learning and basic education. It’s an impressive organization, and I encourage you to consider supporting its work:  https://t.co/fQmyFmjvbm
1224493811344130048 2020-02-04 00:44:09 +0000 <BillGates> I’m excited to team up with @rogerfederer again for the Match in Africa Friday in Cape Town. Playing alongside Roger is always a thrill, and I can’t wait to face off against @RafaelNadal and @Trevornoah.  https://t.co/WMlbBtZwVC
1223295181635510272 2020-01-31 17:21:13 +0000 <BillGates> Thank you, Sue, for all of your contributions to our foundation. I look forward to continuing our work together on important health and education projects that will improve lives.
1223031839717117954 2020-01-30 23:54:48 +0000 <BillGates> Game on!
1222982945704640513 2020-01-30 20:40:30 +0000 <BillGates> If the world keeps up the fight against these neglected tropical diseases, we can improve the lives of millions of families:  https://t.co/Naourwhu9i #WorldNTDDay  https://t.co/eRiBlWI4at
1222607474336858112 2020-01-29 19:48:31 +0000 <BillGates> The world has only begun to tap into all the ways AI will help people live healthier lives. I’m excited about the launch of @Microsoft’s new AI for Health initiative, which connects researchers and organizations with world-class AI talent and resources.  https://t.co/htZZ0YRIfd
1220394569675575298 2020-01-23 17:15:13 +0000 <BillGates> I joined @Twitter ten years (and a couple of days) ago. These are some of my favorite tweets. What’s your favorite tweet from the last ten years?  https://t.co/wnylJeSG3q
1220006544789532678 2020-01-22 15:33:21 +0000 <BillGates> @gavi There are still too many children—many living in some of the hardest-to-reach places on the planet—who aren’t getting basic vaccines. Gavi is the best tool we have to reach them.  #VaccinesWork
1220006293282230277 2020-01-22 15:32:21 +0000 <BillGates> For twenty years, @gavi has worked to ensure that every child in the world is protected from preventable diseases. The results are incredible. But their work is far from done.
1219750261268209664 2020-01-21 22:34:58 +0000 <BillGates> I had a fascinating conversation with Vaclav Smil about what bacteria, babies, empires, and economies all have in common:  https://t.co/HUE9aiFLZz  https://t.co/NBSLul2iMj
1218240511137370112 2020-01-17 18:35:46 +0000 <BillGates> It's great to see Microsoft's leadership in this area. Avoiding the worst effects of climate change will require innovation and investment to get us to net zero carbon emissions across all sectors of the economy.
1217863316548116480 2020-01-16 17:36:56 +0000 <BillGates> These global health heroes have helped Bangladesh become a model for other countries for how to respond to infectious disease outbreaks:  https://t.co/5CEHpFCklp  https://t.co/Kl6ADN43ux
1217519024843771905 2020-01-15 18:48:50 +0000 <BillGates> It’s encouraging to see these results. Typhoid is especially deadly for young children, and a vaccine like this has the potential to save millions of lives.  https://t.co/2CgV8kCLLm
1217166996753780739 2020-01-14 19:30:00 +0000 <BillGates> Thanks to the work of this father–daughter dynamic duo, Bangladesh is moving toward a future of fewer disease outbreaks and more children reaching their fifth birthday.  https://t.co/mMXuxNnnYf
1213998376213086208 2020-01-06 01:39:02 +0000 <BillGates> Solving the world’s toughest challenges—like fighting the worst impacts of climate change—requires lots of new ideas and talented people working across many fields. I’m glad to see this effort to support this important work.
1213843596811612161 2020-01-05 15:24:00 +0000 <BillGates> Progress isn’t always easy to see. These charts show some of the ways that the world is getting better.  https://t.co/gIh6czCZPs
1213158756915105792 2020-01-03 18:02:41 +0000 <BillGates> America’s tax system will be top of mind for many in 2020. Here’s what I really think.  https://t.co/OuiTD1oI4Z
1209169446868262912 2019-12-23 17:50:36 +0000 <BillGates> I’m glad @beautiful__news is highlighting some of the amazing things happening in the world.  https://t.co/MSbKErgru1
1208046545913962511 2019-12-20 15:28:35 +0000 <BillGates> Vaclav Smil is one of my favorite thinkers, and I couldn’t wait to get my hands on his new book about the growth of *everything*.  https://t.co/3R8UWhEcwb
1207681997612748801 2019-12-19 15:20:00 +0000 <BillGates> What’s next for our foundation? I’m particularly excited about what the next year could mean for one of the best buys in global health: vaccines.  https://t.co/MbjNWPEl5l
1207318970166128640 2019-12-18 15:17:28 +0000 <BillGates> I’ve read a lot of books about history over the years, and These Truths by Jill Lepore is the most honest and unflinching account of the American story I’ve ever seen. It’s also one of the most beautifully written.  https://t.co/fYfIFLrmrq
1206953208813371392 2019-12-17 15:04:03 +0000 <BillGates> Check out my end of year books list (plus a bonus recommendation) on @Likewise.  https://t.co/ZE0Sa2ib8u
1206631210530656256 2019-12-16 17:44:33 +0000 <BillGates> December is a great time to take stock of everything you’ve done over the last twelve months—including all of the books you’ve read. I found these books to be really clever and engaging. I hope you them find as intriguing as I did:  https://t.co/xKdpvoXbvR  https://t.co/XZguGFYssO
1206385201594671105 2019-12-16 01:27:00 +0000 <BillGates> Back in my early Microsoft days, I routinely pulled all-nighters when we had to deliver a piece of software. I even stayed up two nights in a row on occasion–I don’t recommend that. This book taught me a lot about the importance of a better night's sleep.  https://t.co/xUthhTyRb6
1206243266276077568 2019-12-15 16:03:00 +0000 <BillGates> This new treatment is a gamechanger for millions of people living with HIV in South Africa. I’m optimistic that it could help #EndAIDS around the world.  https://t.co/vrvqM9DA3w
1205570585373401090 2019-12-13 19:30:00 +0000 <BillGates> I was deeply moved by Tayari Jones’s story of a married couple whose lives get torn apart by an incident of injustice.

1197898412261281792 2019-11-22 15:23:32 +0000 <BillGates> US education may be the hardest issue our foundation works on. A recent visit to The Howard School in Chattanooga, Tennessee reminded me why it’s also one of the most inspiring.  https://t.co/927CwK2imF

And more than 18 million people are walking today who would otherwise have been paralyzed by polio. Here’s why we aren’t done yet:  https://t.co/uXZoglQS7Z  https://t.co/rY2eMaDReI
1197204122933563394 2019-11-20 17:24:40 +0000 <BillGates> The incredible, diverse global partnership that halted wild polio’s spread in Nigeria 3 years ago makes me optimistic we’ll #EndPolio worldwide.  https://t.co/Kr3ibLXdmd
1197012446092894209 2019-11-20 04:43:01 +0000 <BillGates> Some of our most vital partners in the fight to #EndPolio are philanthropies like @alwaleed_philan, @bloombergdotorg, Tahir Foundation, Dalio Philanthropies &amp; Ningxia Yanbao Charity Foundation. Their support has helped deliver vaccines and protect millions from polio paralysis.  https://t.co/w6yUlN1CwX

1193580102237319168 2019-11-10 17:24:06 +0000 <BillGates> The more I’ve learned about Alzheimer’s disease, the more I’ve come to admire the volunteers who participate in clinical trials, and their caregivers too. Here’s a way you can help fight Alzheimer’s:  https://t.co/isfZoyZFPU  https://t.co/rS27wglMOJ
1193324249852846080 2019-11-10 00:27:26 +0000 <BillGates> Better tools for collecting and sharing data will help community health workers protect families in the poorest parts of the world.   https://t.co/dVONnMcY4c
1192871641044226050 2019-11-08 18:28:56 +0000 <BillGates> Expanding the diversity of therapies in the pipeline and more efficiently recruiting patients for clinical trials will increase our odds of discovering a breakthrough. I’m hopeful it will lead to an intervention that reduces the impact of Alzheimer’s.
1192462488895275010 2019-11-07 15:23:06 +0000 <BillGates> @ewarren I’m always willing to talk about creative solutions to these problems.

While we may disagree about some of the ways to get there, we certainly agree we need a lot of smart people committed to finding the path forward.
1192454879454740481 2019-11-07 14:52:52 +0000 <BillGates> @ewarren You and the other candidates are having a really interesting conversation on how to solve some of the world’s toughest problems like eliminating global poverty and avoiding a climate disaster (though those issues don’t get talked about as much as they should).
1191896232643497984 2019-11-06 01:53:00 +0000 <BillGates> One of the many awful things about watching someone you love struggle with Alzheimer’s is the feeling of helplessness. You keep thinking that there must be something more you can do. Here's one option.  https://t.co/TQ1Z0lYCkN

1189874673741381633 2019-10-31 12:00:03 +0000 <BillGates> Buildings are one of the five areas where we need a lot of innovation if we’re going to avoid a climate disaster. I wrote about one company with a particularly clever approach.  https://t.co/OXdxSChPCX
1189580223194509318 2019-10-30 16:30:01 +0000 <BillGates> A lot of work remains, but it’s exciting to see positive data on a drug candidate that may alter the course of Alzheimer’s disease.  https://t.co/h97EBGqWyJ
1189326495900209152 2019-10-29 23:41:47 +0000 <BillGates> I always like to try out a new TV show or two when I’m on the road. What should I watch next? I set up an Ask on @Likewise to collect your recommendations.  https://t.co/6Knu7M3wyO
1189225626919530496 2019-10-29 17:00:58 +0000 <BillGates> "This is a solvable problem." @CarbonCure (which I’ve helped fund through @btenergy Ventures) has developed an innovative way to reduce cement's carbon footprint:  https://t.co/9gvmkPGtnT  https://t.co/zaqUc3In6R
1188430895960743938 2019-10-27 12:23:00 +0000 <BillGates> One of the best parts of my job is getting to work with some of the world’s most brilliant minds on seemingly intractable problems.

1187734206144753664 2019-10-25 14:14:36 +0000 <BillGates> This is one of the most important topics in medicine today: how can we make data more readily available for researchers to look for patterns and identify new pathways for treatment.  https://t.co/hcji8sAhmy
1187437217771225088 2019-10-24 18:34:28 +0000 <BillGates> The world has made incredible progress toward the goal to #endpolio thanks to partners like @MohamedBinZayed and the UAE.
1187141652835721216 2019-10-23 23:00:00 +0000 <BillGates> Melinda and I feel pressure to make every dollar and every day count, which is why we say no to a lot more opportunities than we say yes to. Working with partners around the world to #EndPolio has been a fight worth every dollar.  https://t.co/a3gcP3M2HV
1187107678050574337 2019-10-23 20:45:00 +0000 <BillGates> Tackling the world’s toughest health challenges requires the best that science has to offer. Thank you to @NIHDirector and @WHOAFRO for your partnership.  https://t.co/85nrN9FFS2

1186249019393302529 2019-10-21 11:53:00 +0000 <BillGates> Malnutrition is the single greatest health inequity in the world. In its 2019 State of the World’s Children report, @UNICEF takes a critical look at how we can help everyone reach their full potential by improving access to nutrition.
1186057003686219781 2019-10-20 23:10:00 +0000 <BillGates> The world’s poorest people often rely on farming both to feed their families and to earn an income. They will be among the first to face the effects of climate change. I’m excited about innovations aimed at addressing this problem:  https://t.co/H7KrSXFo4b  https://t.co/1QJg3gyJZY
1185602762127613952 2019-10-19 17:05:00 +0000 <BillGates> Congrats to Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer for winning this year’s @NobelPrize in economics.

1184196873877413888 2019-10-15 19:58:30 +0000 <BillGates> The odds of dying of AIDS in South Africa are less than half what they were at the peak. That progress wouldn’t have been possible without the @GlobalFund and other global health organizations. Even more progress is possible if we keep up the fight:  https://t.co/71W2exSVZT  https://t.co/f2gJwuIb9H
1183098590253764608 2019-10-12 19:14:19 +0000 <BillGates> We need more approaches to stopping #Alzheimers disease. I’m excited to see this news out of @DZNE_de and @ISD_Research about a promising starting point for the development of new therapeutic strategies.  https://t.co/zj81EbL7X6
1182747700548329472 2019-10-11 20:00:00 +0000 <BillGates> I’m impressed by the international cooperation that made this year’s @GlobalFund Replenishment round possible.

1182025200658984960 2019-10-09 20:09:03 +0000 <BillGates> In Afghanistan, one of the last countries with polio, vaccine acceptance rates have reached 98% thanks to the tireless work of female health workers. Their increased involvement and passion is why polio eradication is within reach in Afghanistan.  https://t.co/v2yPVeSCiz
1181943800140324866 2019-10-09 14:45:36 +0000 <BillGates> If all countries in the world had the same concentration of researchers as wealthy ones, there would be 3x as many researchers. That’s mind-blowing. We all lose out when talent isn’t connected with opportunity. @OurWorldInData  https://t.co/a9m56tDdLp
1181686200068800512 2019-10-08 21:41:59 +0000 <BillGates> Malnutrition is the greatest health inequity in the world. I recently spoke with my friend @AlikoDangote about how we can use iodized salt to help kids gets the nutrients they need:  https://t.co/PXp3WeJfEy  https://t.co/qpQ51LWZuf

As remarkable as his contributions to physics were, his biggest accomplishment was inspiring the world to believe in the magic of science and research.  https://t.co/FxiyzmBTuz
1180452588640186369 2019-10-05 12:00:03 +0000 <BillGates> Here is the story of the day I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life and the influence of someone who’s been a critical guide along the way:  https://t.co/KWOicXCab6  https://t.co/R62eDi82yG
1180090191358365696 2019-10-04 12:00:01 +0000 <BillGates> @TheEconomist is right: climate change touches everything and everyone -- and, unfairly, the poor and marginalized have the most to lose.   If you want to understand what can be done, I highly recommend you read this issue.  https://t.co/3JZS3WsAzQ
1179432009929768962 2019-10-02 16:24:38 +0000 <BillGates> Melinda's work on behalf of women and girls around the world inspires me every day. She's committing $1 billion over the next ten years to increasing women's power and influence in the United States. Because #EqualityCantWait.  https://t.co/QHnPyAeN59
1179267012918464512 2019-10-02 05:29:00 +0000 <BillGates> I’m delighted that @erna_solberg has re-upped Norway’s commitment to support the work of the @GlobalFund. I welcome her sustained leadership and partnership in the fight against AIDS, TB, and malaria.

1177588711552409603 2019-09-27 14:20:02 +0000 <BillGates> It's really incredible how much time and effort goes into producing a documentary like the new @netflix series I participated in. I shared more about the experience on my blog:  https://t.co/BgTeiguaFf  https://t.co/UzqI251nxU
1177290900281520128 2019-09-26 18:36:38 +0000 <BillGates> Ending poverty and achieving the SDGs requires a whole-of-government approach. @ImranKhanPTI and @SaniaNishtar have shown leadership in developing a new anti-poverty strategy. #Ehsaas  https://t.co/tbRNz4Gbf6
1176943084984242178 2019-09-25 19:34:32 +0000 <BillGates> .@sanchezcastejon’s commitment to the @GlobalFund reflects Spain’s leadership. At a time when more countries are turning inward, Spain is showing that we can’t back away from our commitment to fighting poverty and disease.
1176719600098013186 2019-09-25 04:46:29 +0000 <BillGates> Sanitation is a difficult issue to take on because there are no easy solutions.

1176565357508780034 2019-09-24 18:33:35 +0000 <BillGates> I had the privilege of meeting @DrElvisEze at last year’s Malaria Summit in London, and I was struck by his optimism about the fight against malaria. I think you’ll be inspired by his story.  https://t.co/92006G0AtA
1176209619804459009 2019-09-23 19:00:00 +0000 <BillGates> I’m excited to see world leaders and climate advocates coming together to make progress at the UNGA #ClimateAction Summit. Working together we can prevent the worst effects of climate change.

1170147147746074625 2019-09-07 01:29:54 +0000 <BillGates> Here’s a remarkable statistic: Nearly 1.1 billion fewer people are living in extreme poverty today than in 1990.  But over 700 million still live on less than $2 a day. Six of them share their stories, their challenges, and their dreams for better lives.  https://t.co/8zjsa5RiP7
1169288834137251845 2019-09-04 16:39:17 +0000 <BillGates> The fact that a quarter of the kids born on the planet don’t get the right food to develop is a mind-blowing tragedy.

1167405102547816450 2019-08-30 11:54:00 +0000 <BillGates> Tuberculosis is still the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. To #EndTB, we need to continue to develop safer and simpler solutions. The FDA’s approval of a new treatment is a promising step in the right direction.  https://t.co/dJQapVKgjW
1166424894416007168 2019-08-27 18:59:00 +0000 <BillGates> Whenever I hear an idea for what we can do to keep global warming in check, I always ask this question: “What’s your plan for steel?”   I know it sounds like an odd thing to say, but it opens the door to a very important subject.  https://t.co/Oo20WYmkAZ
1166260706322321409 2019-08-27 08:06:35 +0000 <BillGates> Germany, Italy, and the European Commission have demonstrated great leadership with their commitments to the @GlobalFund.

1165013203769802754 2019-08-23 21:29:27 +0000 <BillGates> Canada’s $930 million commitment to the @GlobalFund is a big step towards saving millions of lives.

1164224148819849222 2019-08-21 17:14:01 +0000 <BillGates> Today marks three years since Nigeria's last wild poliovirus case. This progress wouldn’t have been possible without the bravery of the young women who volunteer as polio vaccinators.  https://t.co/Nmn2PoN5dv

1161732473249783815 2019-08-14 20:13:00 +0000 <BillGates> Four billion people are at risk from mosquito-borne diseases. We can get that number down to zero if we invest in new tools — like a set of techniques for genetically modifying mosquitoes — to complement the ones we already have.  https://t.co/YSemQDFsw6
1161284341198217216 2019-08-13 14:32:17 +0000 <BillGates> Melinda and I are big fans of @DonorsChoose, and we were thrilled to learn that @WKamauBell is, too.

1160212690041745408 2019-08-10 15:33:55 +0000 <BillGates> Being poor isn’t cheap. It’s hundreds of times more expensive to use charging stations than it is to charge a phone at home. That’s just one of the hidden costs of unreliable electricity:  https://t.co/1RTxaL1chd  https://t.co/ymKCJo83em
1159831816188022785 2019-08-09 14:20:28 +0000 <BillGates> Whenever I want to understand something better, I pick up a book. Here are some of the best ones I’ve read so far this year:  https://t.co/Q9RFZW6uid #BookLoversDay  https://t.co/wwg8lsG3jI
1159146620186955776 2019-08-07 16:57:44 +0000 <BillGates> There is no question that reliable electricity unlocks a better life for people. But can we power the world without contributing to climate change? I think we can:  https://t.co/33sGjLspfT  https://t.co/NRjXc2HReH
1158434613250920449 2019-08-05 17:48:29 +0000 <BillGates> Think back to the last time you experienced a power outage. If you live in New York, you don’t have to think that far back! Now imagine what it would be like not to have access to electricity at all. Nearly one billion people face that reality every day.  https://t.co/4jg2JC7EVQ
1156978147398705158 2019-08-01 17:21:00 +0000 <BillGates> Five years ago, India was declared polio-free. This incredible milestone was made possible by the health workers, governments, partners, and donors who didn’t rest until every child was reached. I can’t wait to see what India achieves next.  https://t.co/p5G2WuwPZb
1155911372888260608 2019-07-29 18:42:01 +0000 <BillGates> What if we really are all in this together? In this fascinating book, @NAChristakis explains why and how humans evolved to work together:  https://t.co/SkaMiLYjkn  https://t.co/l8gzfoWYCu

1155629006823337986 2019-07-29 00:00:00 +0000 <BillGates> It's hard to overstate how important finding a better diagnostic is for fighting #Alzheimers. That’s why I’m investing in new ideas for easier and more accurate diagnosis of the disease.  https://t.co/WM9phNmyJo
1154787966256058368 2019-07-26 16:18:00 +0000 <BillGates> If you read one article about climate change this week, check out this one from @voxdotcom. Government support for energy R&amp;D is one of the best opportunities to fight climate change.  https://t.co/fke57WYxM3
1153762593967955969 2019-07-23 20:23:32 +0000 <BillGates> Are our similarities powerful enough to overcome our differences? “Blueprint” is an optimistic (and terrific) book that explores why humans have evolved to work together and cooperate.  https://t.co/mQz07WvFgm

1151892739832893440 2019-07-18 16:33:24 +0000 <BillGates> This is something I would have loved as a kid: @MicrosoftStore is hosting a series of free Camp Know Where events across the country. If your kids love science (and @Stranger_Things), I encourage you to check them out.

Here’s an update on the progress we’ve made in the first year of the program – and what’s next:  https://t.co/pjkgxeZq3z  https://t.co/6OabhP3Pd9
1150605518291001345 2019-07-15 03:18:27 +0000 <BillGates> I recently wrote about how people with tech skills can find fascinating problems to work on in global health and development. I was excited to come across this @techreview article about African machine learning researchers who are already doing just that.  https://t.co/3e1d2QvvH4
1149722840847015942 2019-07-12 16:51:00 +0000 <BillGates> “Fathers who help unlock their daughter’s potential, standing up for their rights and raising them to believe they have them, bring prosperity and happiness to their entire families.” I recommend reading this essay from @ZiauddinY about @Malala. #MalalaDay  https://t.co/SRqQjSa4vA
1149446129945366528 2019-07-11 22:31:27 +0000 <BillGates> Nearly one billion malaria cases have been prevented since 2000, but infection rates have plateaued or even increased in some areas. @axios explains how we can #StepUptheFight and end the disease for good.  https://t.co/EKLQb8q1IH
1148674683883151360 2019-07-09 19:26:00 +0000 <BillGates> Can we feed 10 billion people? I’m optimistic that we can if we invest in research that will help poor farmers adapt to climate change.  https://t.co/KjKNQRMBJy
1146559254104616960 2019-07-03 23:20:02 +0000 <BillGates> Nuclear power is the second-largest source of low-carbon electricity in the world — but its growth is slowing down. This important @IEA report outlines how countries can support existing reactors and advance nuclear innovation.  https://t.co/cS9cuHn1WA
1146468903838715904 2019-07-03 17:21:01 +0000 <BillGates> I wish I had understood much earlier in my career what true inequity looks like and how to fight it. That’s why I’m inspired by the story of William Wu, an engineer who started using his tech skills to fight inequity much sooner than I did:  https://t.co/qEDOk3kVEo  https://t.co/WDxHCur6Ki
1145696067285114881 2019-07-01 14:10:03 +0000 <BillGates> This is the teletype that brought Paul Allen and me together. And I’m so glad that it did. Paul was one of the most thoughtful, brilliant, and curious people I’ve ever met:  https://t.co/CNw9gc5Xh7  https://t.co/pC9FIQ0kK5
1145366855693082625 2019-06-30 16:21:52 +0000 <BillGates> More people are getting their electricity from renewable sources that ever before. Here’s how we can build on the progress we’ve made:  https://t.co/ftMb24y6sd  https://t.co/46kGyQP7EQ

1144655202622083072 2019-06-28 17:14:01 +0000 <BillGates> My friendship with Paul Allen changed my life. I loved sharing some of my favorite stories about him (and a few old photos!) at the Forbes Philanthropy Summit yesterday:  https://t.co/3i6SFNg9q4  https://t.co/t2t7yTBVie
1144213033679491072 2019-06-27 11:57:00 +0000 <BillGates> Few inventions have changed our lives as much as the battery. I’m excited that more inventors and investors are being attracted to the quest to build a better one.  https://t.co/KAyNoiaXzr

1139912424784637953 2019-06-15 15:07:55 +0000 <BillGates> Fighting disease is like fighting fire. It’s not enough to put out most of it — you have to get it all. @Rotary’s generous pledge to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will help us extinguish this terrible disease for good.
1139571584342138881 2019-06-14 16:33:32 +0000 <BillGates> The fight against malaria is one of the greatest success stories in global health — but progress has slowed in recent years. To regain momentum, we must work together to combat drug and insecticide resistance.  https://t.co/2vw0LMzEuX
1139204917757956096 2019-06-13 16:16:32 +0000 <BillGates> I was moved by this story: Bob’s daughter has Down syndrome, which puts her at a higher risk for dementia. Motivated by her condition and his love of science, he volunteered for an #Alzheimers clinical trial.  https://t.co/tfQScwYo2J

1133786736109150209 2019-05-29 17:26:37 +0000 <BillGates> I recently sat down with one of my favorite authors, Jared Diamond. His perspective on political polarization really caught my attention:  https://t.co/cfPHMmYgcw  https://t.co/F88NEAzZLp

1117839639195205636 2019-04-15 17:18:33 +0000 <BillGates> Shapeshifters are not just the stuff of science fiction, though. We have them right here on earth.
1117839638612234240 2019-04-15 17:18:32 +0000 <BillGates> There’s an epic scene at the end where Spock has to figure out which one is the impostor.  https://t.co/yOSI4WyneG

1115664644230733824 2019-04-09 17:15:53 +0000 <BillGates> “The Moment of Lift” is a wise, honest, and beautifully written book about how empowering women lifts up everyone.

1111626456021397504 2019-03-29 13:49:34 +0000 <BillGates> Pivot Bio has developed an alternative to synthetic fertilizer that could help transform farming and reduce greenhouse gas emissions:  https://t.co/3keIlFe2MR  https://t.co/iAdaBmKFVI
1111364562920431616 2019-03-28 20:28:54 +0000 <BillGates> I’m thrilled that senators from both sides of the aisle have come together to support advanced nuclear. This is exactly the kind of leadership our country needs to both solve the climate challenge and reassert our leadership in this important industry.
1111364562354229248 2019-03-28 20:28:54 +0000 <BillGates> Nuclear energy is one of these critical technologies. It’s ideal for dealing with climate change, because it is the only carbon-free, scalable energy source that’s available 24 hours a day.
1111364561733480448 2019-03-28 20:28:54 +0000 <BillGates> To prevent the worst effects of climate change, we need to reach near-zero emissions on all the things that drive it—agriculture, electricity, manufacturing, transportation, and buildings—by investing in innovation across all sectors while deploying low cost renewables.
1111364561033027585 2019-03-28 20:28:54 +0000 <BillGates> Yesterday, a bipartisan group of leaders in the U.S. Senate introduced the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act, which establishes an ambitious plan to accelerate the development of advanced nuclear reactor technologies. I can’t overstate how important this is.  https://t.co/tRovGTm2sg
1110608032528924672 2019-03-26 18:22:43 +0000 <BillGates> We need to reach zero net emissions from every sector of the economy including agriculture (which, along with forestry, and land use, is responsible for almost as much greenhouse gas emissions as electricity).  https://t.co/Sioivi1R9L
1110608031283240960 2019-03-26 18:22:43 +0000 <BillGates> Most discussions about fighting climate change focus on electricity and the need for renewable energy. De-carbonizing the way we generate electricity would be a huge step, but it won’t be enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change.  https://t.co/C4oCIz6iXg
1110013437793443841 2019-03-25 03:00:01 +0000 <BillGates> Five years ago, India was declared poliofree. Whenever someone asks me how they did it, I tell them about one of the country’s lowest castes: the Musahar.  https://t.co/X6AZTigffl  https://t.co/I2Ija5AyKY

1106193271380951040 2019-03-14 14:00:02 +0000 <BillGates> Medical advances should be available to everyone who needs them. That’s why I’m excited about an inexpensive blood test that could help doctors predict if a baby will be born prematurely. This information would undoubtedly save lives.  https://t.co/GsCYZU7gqs

1079376322529382406 2018-12-30 13:59:03 +0000 <BillGates> Gene editing might be the most important public debate we’re not having right now. Read up on it whenever you have a chance. Even better, read @DrSidMukherjee’s “The Gene.”  https://t.co/4qM8faMGkp
1079376321875128321 2018-12-30 13:59:03 +0000 <BillGates> The good news is that there has been progress toward a vaccine that would protect you from every possible strain of the flu. But the world still needs to develop a global system for responding to epidemics.

1079376316913184769 2018-12-30 13:59:02 +0000 <BillGates> Just over a year ago, I made my first investment in Alzheimer’s research. I’m hopeful that we can make a lot of progress in the coming years.

1040598795497529344 2018-09-14 13:51:00 +0000 <BillGates> The world has never been better, but not everyone has reaped the benefits. So it’s great to see Mackenzie &amp; @JeffBezos are launching two bold initiatives to help some of the most vulnerable people in our communities. I can’t wait to see the difference their work makes.
1040328670827737092 2018-09-13 19:57:38 +0000 <BillGates> Tenaw Muluye is helping his country grow — literally.

One of those reasons is bipartisan support for more @NIH funded research from forward-thinking leaders like @PattyMurray and @RoyBlunt.  https://t.co/vzasxN6NIB

1038835176036556800 2018-09-09 17:03:01 +0000 <BillGates> I don’t always agree with @harari_yuval’s conclusions, but I have a tremendous amount of respect for his intellect and ambition as a writer.

It’s been half a century since his victory at the first Open, but his impact is still being felt today.  https://t.co/HAMijmwf6C
1038032382719414273 2018-09-07 11:53:00 +0000 <BillGates> Like all of his books, @harari_yuval’s “21 Lessons for the 21st Century” is focused on big questions. Harari has a lot of great answers—and a few I disagreed with in my review for @nytimesbooks.  https://t.co/G7aPQOuLKn
1037702711851069440 2018-09-06 14:03:00 +0000 <BillGates> Computer science changed the course of my life. I recently visited a public high school that hopes to do the same thing for young people in New York:  https://t.co/OSkHaiW5oL  https://t.co/pVlC6F7SvD
1037608086180122625 2018-09-06 07:47:00 +0000 <BillGates> My friend Bono knows better than anyone what brings people together. In @faznet, he argues that European leaders need to appeal to people's hearts, not just their heads.  https://t.co/rAoqYRj3mo
1037403611859492865 2018-09-05 18:14:29 +0000 <BillGates> .@afsenyc is doing great work preparing its students for life after high school, and for a lifetime of asking “how does it work?” and “how can I make it better?”  https://t.co/7KCdZVnwIr
1037073462718808066 2018-09-04 20:22:36 +0000 <BillGates> When I wanted to learn something outside of school as a kid, cracking open my encyclopedia was the best I could do. Today, you just have to go online. For students headed back to school (and learners of all ages), here are my favorite learning hacks:  https://t.co/lFo4aqI0WN  https://t.co/2U0zmASdph
1035859818735722497 2018-09-01 12:00:00 +0000 <BillGates> SHOFCO co-founder @KennedyOdede is part of a new generation of African leaders working towards a better, brighter future for all young people. Congrats to Kennedy and @JessRPosner on receiving this year’s #HiltonPrize.

1035485600747606016 2018-08-31 11:13:00 +0000 <BillGates> Income can often tell you more about how people live than location can. Whenever I visit a new place, I look for clues about which income level local families live on. These clues tell me a lot about the people there.  https://t.co/S4VCRz8DE7
1035184804373778433 2018-08-30 15:17:44 +0000 <BillGates> From 2007 to 2015, the percentage of students on track to graduate from Chicago high schools rose from 61% to 85%.

1034820550911131648 2018-08-29 15:10:20 +0000 <BillGates> Great leadership by PM @theresa_may and her government. Foreign aid makes the UK more secure, prevents diseases, strengthens markets, and saves lives. #AidWorks
1034770891136229376 2018-08-29 11:53:00 +0000 <BillGates> Wind and solar won’t reach their potential until we vastly improve energy storage. There are some exciting companies working in this space (like @Bill_Gross and Andrea Pedretti’s Energy Vault), but we need even more innovation.  https://t.co/bBT4lQoPq3

1033538684841123841 2018-08-26 02:16:39 +0000 <BillGates> My thoughts are with John McCain's family, friends, and colleagues. His passing is a loss for our country.

1031329972311535616 2018-08-20 00:00:01 +0000 <BillGates> I hate mosquitoes. The diseases they spread kill more than half a million people every year. In fact, mosquitoes kill more people in one day than sharks kill in 100 years:  https://t.co/r81u9DDB2B #WorldMosquitoDay  https://t.co/j6DB4yZ4m9
1030858372348694529 2018-08-18 16:46:03 +0000 <BillGates> Kofi Annan was one of the great peacemakers of our time. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work with him on many occasions. I’m sad to learn of his death.  https://t.co/VM9QJyzaT3
1029414783190069248 2018-08-14 17:09:44 +0000 <BillGates> If you want to understand why this matters, I highly recommend the new book “Capitalism Without Capital” by @haskelecon and @stianwestlake. Here’s my review:  https://t.co/7VU7i8wvPA
1029414782237986817 2018-08-14 17:09:44 +0000 <BillGates> The portion of the global economy that doesn’t fit the old model just keeps getting larger. But the rules that govern the economy haven’t kept up. This is one of the biggest trends in the global economy that isn’t getting enough attention.
1029414780954505216 2018-08-14 17:09:44 +0000 <BillGates> Unlike the goods that powered our economy in the past, software is an intangible asset -- “something you can’t touch.” And it’s not the only example: data, insurance, e-books, even movies work in similar ways.
1029414778710552578 2018-08-14 17:09:43 +0000 <BillGates> This chart assumes that the total cost of production increases as supply increases. When a car company makes a new vehicle, the 10th car costs the same to manufacture as the 1000th.
1029414776735059968 2018-08-14 17:09:43 +0000 <BillGates> At the time I was in college, this was basically how the global economy worked...  https://t.co/2polaSbsXY

1027930961756004352 2018-08-10 14:53:33 +0000 <BillGates> One in five students who plan to attend college don’t actually enroll. @GeorgiaStateU, a school I visited last year, used chatbots to reduce “summer melt” by 21%:  https://t.co/OatrCs5Z54  https://t.co/G99itf15dO

1026909710866436099 2018-08-07 19:15:28 +0000 <BillGates> The transformation of Rwanda’s health system has its roots in a very simple, but powerful belief: everyone deserves a shot at a healthy life, no matter their income, ethnic group, or where they call home.  https://t.co/qRbsrnBwho
1026104789334196224 2018-08-05 13:57:00 +0000 <BillGates> The world is facing some big challenges. I’m always thrilled to read about companies that find bold solutions.  https://t.co/DsW5htNcHw

1024656409324150790 2018-08-01 14:01:39 +0000 <BillGates> I talk a lot about new inventions that are saving lives around the world. But some breakthrough ideas don’t involve any technology at all.   https://t.co/DNYw4VQ5wo
1023931760806047745 2018-07-30 14:02:10 +0000 <BillGates> Excellent news. The success against Ebola in the DRC underscores the importance of investing to prepare for future outbreaks.
1023207558528393217 2018-07-28 14:04:26 +0000 <BillGates> I had a great conversation with @TeamGleason when I met him a few years ago.  I’m thrilled to see how @Microsoft has taken his challenge to use technology to empower others.
1022712786449846272 2018-07-27 05:18:24 +0000 <BillGates> I read @TheEconomist cover-to-cover because its content makes me think critically about the world. Its editors recently asked me a tough question: What is the one thing you'd do to create a more open world? See my answer below and share your answer here:  https://t.co/snng1yCdRL
1022120455749230592 2018-07-25 14:04:41 +0000 <BillGates> Global health hero @rajpanjabi has dedicated his life to delivering basic health care to people who live beyond the reach of the health system:  https://t.co/7pubJN7rRy  https://t.co/3G1gVPvkQN

986578343184265216 2018-04-18 12:13:01 +0000 <BillGates> As an investor, I’m always on the lookout for the next big idea.

984093469487575040 2018-04-11 15:39:01 +0000 <BillGates> Genome editing is one of the most powerful technologies of the 21st century. It’s important that new tools such as CRISPR continue to be applied – subject to rigorous guidelines – so the world can continue to make remarkable progress.  https://t.co/VVWY6RkCph
983767844398694406 2018-04-10 18:05:06 +0000 <BillGates> “You’re not alone.”  This simple phrase has helped HIV survivor Cacilda Fumo save hundreds of lives every year.  https://t.co/4xDQZzJ9q2

982984204727152640 2018-04-08 14:11:12 +0000 <BillGates> What we need is increased government and private sector support. Creating a zero-carbon future will take time, which is all the more reason to get started now.
982984203519254529 2018-04-08 14:11:11 +0000 <BillGates> But I am more optimistic than he is. I think innovation—and the urgency brought on by climate change—will speed up the process when it comes to clean energy.
982984199685652485 2018-04-08 14:11:10 +0000 <BillGates> Vaclav Smil is one of my favorite authors. I’ve read nearly all of his 37 books. This is an excellent overview of how Smil has helped shape how people (myself included) think about energy.  https://t.co/FEOkVkVyaH
982266178620932103 2018-04-06 14:38:01 +0000 <BillGates> Ironman triathlete and polio survivor @mindadentler’s story is incredible. Her commitment to eradicating the disease that paralyzed her inspires me to keep fighting to #endpolio.  https://t.co/MpldqyS1xS

981532684211052545 2018-04-04 14:03:22 +0000 <BillGates> I can’t recommend Factfulness highly enough. Hans and two family members wrote it at the end of his life, and it’s a wonderful summary of everything he stood for. Here’s my full review.  https://t.co/vwU2a21ZYW
981532681413390336 2018-04-04 14:03:21 +0000 <BillGates> I use this one all the time: “Big numbers always look big. Small numbers on their own are misleading… Always look for comparisons.”  https://t.co/nl9VK3t2iP
981532678645141504 2018-04-04 14:03:21 +0000 <BillGates> “Slow change is still change.” Extreme poverty has gone down by an average 2.5% per year in the last two decades. Over time, that adds up to a 50% drop.  https://t.co/3lymk8bjgX
981532675176505345 2018-04-04 14:03:20 +0000 <BillGates> “Give the system some credit.” It’s great to celebrate heroes (I do!). But there were heroes 1,000 years ago, and life was awful. Modernity—being able to flush the toilet and turn on the lights—is a miracle of systems plus heroes.  https://t.co/c92VUmlbjP
981532672580190208 2018-04-04 14:03:19 +0000 <BillGates> “Things can be both better and bad.” This is the heart of our foundation’s work. It’s bad that 5 million children die every year—but it’s better than it was, which is why I think it can keep improving.  https://t.co/hcYm3u0kX1
981532669358911488 2018-04-04 14:03:19 +0000 <BillGates> “Factfulness,” by the late Hans Rosling, is one of the best books I’ve read in a long time. It’s a great guide to thinking clearly about the world. Here are some of my favorite tips…  https://t.co/0TfEtVqNof
981222802635284480 2018-04-03 17:32:01 +0000 <BillGates> It’s hard to pick up on progress if you divide the world into developed countries and developing countries. In his newly-released book, Hans Rosling offers a better framework. You can download a free excerpt here…  https://t.co/lK4xtl4DeV
980912758148489218 2018-04-02 21:00:00 +0000 <BillGates> Good news: the world’s newest country reported zero cases of Guinea worm in 2017 and hasn’t had a case in 15 months.  https://t.co/uOo4MMEtFm
980052089337499649 2018-03-31 12:00:01 +0000 <BillGates> My family loved talking about this book at the dinner table, and I think yours will, too.  https://t.co/vVqVFlTSG0

977222062807834624 2018-03-23 16:34:30 +0000 <BillGates> Companies in Nigeria are taking a big step to end stunting and malnutrition. This commitment will build healthier and more prosperous communities.  https://t.co/iYhdt9SMiU
976927872773382144 2018-03-22 21:05:29 +0000 <BillGates> I’m hopeful we can alter the course of Alzheimer's if we invest in research to better understand how the disease unfolds. #ShareTheOrange is a promising new campaign to support Alzheimer’s research. @ARUKnews  https://t.co/E7BJ3U5VMF
976861821423575044 2018-03-22 16:43:02 +0000 <BillGates> Strong health systems promote strong economic growth. Nigeria’s investments in its communities will yield benefits for years to come. #ImagineNigeria  https://t.co/ftew1CjWsG

974013655443386368 2018-03-14 20:05:26 +0000 <BillGates> Developing affordable, clean energy for all is one of the smartest public investments our country can make. We need lots of innovation to get there, and @ARPAE is leading the way:  https://t.co/thKFCIsq6o #ARPAE18
973659967231275008 2018-03-13 20:40:00 +0000 <BillGates> I often meet with educators who have creative ideas about how to make school systems work for every child.

971765781729087488 2018-03-08 15:13:11 +0000 <BillGates> The evidence is clear: if you want to empower women and girls, give them the power to decide what to do with their own money. #IWD2018  https://t.co/YO5gJ6f7Zl
971571964929245184 2018-03-08 02:23:02 +0000 <BillGates> Tomorrow is #IWD2018 — a day when the world celebrates the progress made by and for women. I’m inspired by Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. She was recently awarded the Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership.  https://t.co/4duvTvu2a5
